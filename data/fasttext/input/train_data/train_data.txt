__label__nonastro Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of  paper, I used to take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that  happened momentarily to  shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship cr ossing its disk; a group of  reeds and water-flags, and a naiad’s head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow’s nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.

__label__astro A natural solution is for mass loading to reduce the ﬁnal velocity of the out ﬂow (Metzger & Stone 2016 ), allowing it to be originally launched from smaller radii while matching the velocity seen in the absorption features.
__label__nonastro John no one thwarted, much less punished; though he twisted the necks of  the pigeons, killed the  little pea-chicks, set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,  and broke the buds off the  choicest plants in the conservatory: he called his mother “old girl,” too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin, similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not  unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire; and he was  still “her own darling.”  I da red commit no fault: I strove  to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to night.
__label__astro This observed bimodal distribution supports the idea of the binary and single Be star formation chan- nels producing populations with di erent nitrogen enrichments, and would suggest that in NGC 2004 the binary formation chan- nel dominates.
