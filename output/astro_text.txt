__label__positive This new map contains three major improvements over our previous work.
__label__positive First, the inclusion of Gaia parallaxes dramatically improves distance estimates to nearby stars.
__label__positive Second, we incorporate a spatial prior that correlates the dust density across nearby sightlines.
__label__positive This produces a smoother map, with more isotropic clouds and smaller distance uncertainties, particularly to clouds within the nearest kiloparsec.
__label__positive Third, we infer the dust densitywith a distance resolution that is four times ﬁner than in our previous work, to accommodate the improvements in signal-to-noise enabled by the other improvements.
__label__positive As part of this work, we infer the distances, reddenings, and types of 799 million stars.

__label__positive Introduction Dust is both a critical foreground for many astrophysical measurements and a tracer of Galactic structure and star-forming regions.
__label__positive In the ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared,dust causes both extinction and reddening.
__label__positive It is necessary tocorrect for these effects in order to measure intrinsic luminosities or colors of obscured objects.
__label__positive For extragalactic astronomy, a two-dimensional map of integrated dust extinc-tion and reddening is suf ﬁcient, while for sources embedded in the Milky Way, a distance-dependent correction for dustobscuration is necessary.
__label__positive Dust emits strongly in the mid- andfar-infrared, and thus provides an important foreground for thecosmic microwave background, further motivating accurate maps of the distribution of Galactic dust.
__label__positive Far-infrared emission of dust can be used to construct two- dimensional maps of dust reddening.
__label__positive (1998, hereafter “SFD”)model far-infrared dust emission as a modiﬁed blackbody, deriving maps of dust optical depth and temperature.
__label__positive Assuming a linear relation between dust optical depth at 100 μm and reddening at optical wavelengths, SFD calibrate their optical depth map against measurements of -EBV() from elliptical galaxies, obtaining a full-sky map of Galactic dust reddening at optical wavelengths.
__label__positive Because it isnot possible to determine the distance to the emitting dust fromfar-infrared intensity alone, this method does not recover thethree-dimensional distribution of dust.
__label__positive In addition, the relationbetween far-infrared optical depth and optical reddeningdepends on the dust composition and grain-size distribution, and thus varies throughout the Galaxy, introducing systematic errors into the resulting reddening maps.One method of overcoming these limitations is to use optical stellar photometry to trace dust.
__label__positive Stellar distances can be determined (both from spectral models and from geometric parallax measurements ), allowing one to trace reddening as a function of both position on the sky and distance.
__label__positive In addition, stellar colors are a more direct measurement of optical reddening, obviating the need to convert from far-infrared optical depth to reddening at optical wavelengths.
__label__positive Several works have now used optical and near-infrared stellar photometry to trace dust in 3D.
__label__positive In lieu of an extensivesummary, a few works will be mentioned here.
__label__positive (2006 )use near-infrared colors of post-main-sequence stars in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (Skrutskie et al.
__label__positive 2006, hereafter “2MASS ”)to map dust in 3D, while Berry et al.
__label__positive (2012 )use the optical and near-infrared colors of stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (York et al.
__label__positive These methods have matured with the introduction of probabilistic models that infer both the distribution of dust and the types and distances of stars.
__label__positive (2014 )apply a hierarchical Bayesian model of the distribution of dust, as well as stellar distances and types, to the INT Photometric H α Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane (Drew et al.
__label__positive (2015 )model Pan-STARRS 1 and 2MASS photometry of ∼800 million stars over three-quarters of the sky to create a map that extends to a few kiloparsecs.
__label__positive (2018 )improve upon this map, with both updated Pan-STARRS 1 photometry and methodological improve- ments.
__label__positive (2014 )use catalog distances and reddenings of stars to trace dust, but apply a Gaussian process prior to the spatial distribution of dust, enforcing smoothness on small spatial scales.
__label__positive Recently, the availability of geometric parallax measure- ments from Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al.
__label__positive 2016 )has given aThe Astrophysical Journal, 887:93 (27pp ), 2019 December 10 https://doi.org /10.3847 /1538-4357 /ab5362 © 2019.
__label__positive Whereas most previous studies of the 3D distribution of dust have relied on stellar spectral energydistribution models to determine distances to stars, Gaia more directly constrains the distances to the hundreds of millions of stars for which it precisely measures parallaxes.
__label__positive In addition,Gaia measures stellar optical photometry, which Andrae et al.(2018 )use to estimate stellar reddenings and extinctions.
__label__positive (2019 )estimate stellar reddenings from Gaia photometry and parallaxes, producing an all-sky map of dust reddening in 3D.
__label__positive Leike & Enßlin (2019 )combine the extinction estimates from Andrae et al.
__label__positive (2018 )with a Gaussian process model for the spatial distribution of dust to map reddening within a few hundred parsecs of the Sun.
__label__positive (2019 )combine Gaia parallaxes with photometry from Gaia and 2MASS to estimate stellar distances and reddenings, and model the spatial distribution of dust as a Gaussian process, obtaining a map that extends a few kiloparsecs in the midplane of the Galaxy.
__label__positive In the following, we present a new 3D map of dust reddening, based on Gaia parallaxes and broadband optical and near-infrared photometry.
__label__positive We make several major improve- ments over Green et al.
__label__positive (2018 ), incorporating Gaia parallaxes into our model, improving the distance resolution of the map by a factor of four, and imposing a Gaussian process prior on the distribution of dust.
__label__positive For stars with precisely measured Gaia parallaxes, we obtain dramatically more precise distance determinations than is possible with broadband photometry alone.
__label__positive The imposition of a Gaussian process prior on thedistribution of dust not only regularizes the resulting map, but also allows us to more precisely determine distances to dust clouds within ∼1 kpc.
__label__positive Our method produces not only a map of the 3D distribution of dust reddening, but also a catalog of distances, reddenings, and types for 799 million stars.
__label__positive Our 3D dust map may be accessed at doi: 10.7910 /DVN/2EJ9TX , while our catalog of stellar parameters may be accessed at doi: 10.7910 /DVN/ AV9GXO .
__label__positive In addition, our dust map can be accessed through the Python package dustmaps (Green 2018 ).
__label__positive Section 2reviews our method for inferring stellar properties (Section 2.1 ) and the distribution of dust along each sightline (Section 2.2 ), and then describes a new method for imposing a correlated prior on thedust, linking nearby sightlines (Section 2.3 ).
__label__positive This latter process yields a map in which dust densities in nearby voxels, spanning different sightlines, are correlated, dependent on the distancebetween the voxels.
__label__positive Section 3describes the survey data we use, from Gaia, Pan-STARRS 1, and 2MASS.
__label__positive Section 4presents our new 3D dust map, compares it to previous dust maps,assesses evidence in our map for spiral structure in the Milky Way, and presents our catalog of stellar parameters.
__label__positive Section 5 discusses ways forward for dust mapping.
__label__positive Method Here, we sketch out our method for determining the three- dimensional distribution of dust, as well as stellar types and distances.
__label__positive In brief, we use stars as tracers of the dust column,modeling the apparent magnitudes and parallaxes of stars as a function of their type, distance, and foreground reddening.
__label__positive We then group the stars into discrete sightlines, using the stellardistances and reddenings to constrain the dust as a function ofdistance.The method for inferring types and distances for single stars is much the same as in Green et al.
__label__positive (2015,2018 ), with the addition of Gaia parallaxes.
__label__positive However, we have signi ﬁcantly updated our method for sampling the dust reddening alongindividual sightlines, allowing us to increase the number ofdistance bins by a factor of four while decreasing the computational runtime, and we have implemented a new iterative scheme for imposing a prior with correlations betweennearby sightlines.
__label__positive Single-star Inference For an individual star with measured photometry, mˆ, and parallax,vˆ, we wish to determine the star ’s type, Θ, distance modulus, μ, and reddening, E.
__label__positive We can write down the posterior probability density of these parameters, given the data, as mvvm m vQ=QQpE mpm Ep E pm,, ,,, , , , ,.1 (∣ ˆˆ)(ˆˆ∣ )( ) (ˆˆ)() Because the photometry and parallax are observed, ﬁxed quantities, we can treat vpm,(ˆˆ)as a constant, so mv v m mQµ Q QpE mp m E pE,, , , ,, ,, .
__label__positive 2(∣ ˆˆ) ( ˆˆ∣ )( ) () If we are given the type, distance modulus, and reddening of a star, we can look up its model magnitudes, QMmodel(), using the stellar templates described in Green et al.
__label__positive (2015 ), and predict its parallax, which is simply a function of distancemodulus, vm().
__label__positive Comparison of these model observables with the observed photometry and parallax yields the likelihoodterm, vmQpm E,, ,(ˆˆ∣ ) , which is a multivariate Gaussian: ms ~Q + +mM A E ,, 3m model ˆ [( ) ( ) ] ( ) vv m s~ v  ,.
__label__positive 4 ˆ[ ( ) ] ( ) Here, σmandσϖare the uncertainty in the observed magnitudes and parallax, and AE()is the extinction in the observed passbands, assumed to be a linear function of reddening, E.
__label__positive For each star, we assume that extinction is given by = AREE ,5 () ( ) where Ris the “extinction vector, ”relating a scalar reddening to the extinction in each passband.
__label__positive We use the RV=3.3 empirical reddening vector from Schla ﬂye ta l .
__label__positive (2016 ),c o n v e r t i n gi tt oa n extinction vector by requiring that AH/AK=1.55 (Indebetouw et al.
__label__positive 2005 )and that -=Egr 0.901 magP1 P1 () when E= 1 mag.
__label__positive The latter choice puts our measure of reddening on ascale similar to that of the recalibrated SFD (Schla ﬂy& Finkbeiner 2011 )and previous versions of our map (Green et al.
__label__positive The resulting extinction vector is given in Table 1.
__label__positive This extinction vector is slightly different from the one we use inGreen et al.

__label__positive An equivalent amount of reddening thus translates into a greater amount of extinction in this work than in Green et al.
__label__positive In the Kspassband, for example, the new extinction vector predicts 88% more extinction per unit -Egr() reddening than the previous vector.
__label__positive This change is much less pronounced in optical wavelengths; in gP1, the new extinction vector predicts only 4% more extinction per unit -Egr() reddening.
__label__positive The slope of the reddening vectors, as de ﬁned by --EXY E gr() ( ) ,w h e r e Xand Yare two arbitrary passbands, is similar between Green et al.
__label__positive See Section 4.3.1 for a numerical comparison of the line- of-sight reddenings derived by these two works.
__label__positive We place priors on the distribution of stars of different types throughout the Galaxy, yielding a joint prior on distancemodulus and type, mQp,() .
__label__positive For reasons that will become clear in Section 2.2, we place a ﬂat prior on the reddening of each star: =pE const () .
__label__positive We evaluate the posterior density of each star, mvpE m,,(∣ ˆˆ), on a grid of distance modulus mÎ4m a g ,1 9m a g[ ]in steps of 0.125 mag and ÎE 0m a g ,7m a g[] in steps of 0.01 mag.
__label__positive Note that stellar type, Θ, has been integrated out here.
__label__positive Our procedure for evaluating this posterior density quickly over a regular grid isexplained in Appendix A.
__label__positive This new method is both faster and more accurate than the evaluation technique used in our previous work, which involved kernel density estimation on samples drawn using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC ).
__label__positive (2015,2018 ), we smooth the stellar probability density functions along the reddening axis with a Gaussian kernel, which is equivalent to treating reddening within each pixel as a white noise process at any givendistance.
__label__positive This takes into account the small-scale power in thedust density spectrum, allowing reddening to vary across asingle angular pixel.
__label__positive The Gaussian smoothing applied is afraction of the reddening in the pixel, as explained in Section2.2 of Green et al.
__label__positive We make one change to the smoothing method developed in Green et al.
__label__positive (2015 ), in that we increase the minimum reddening smoothing percentage to 15%and the maximum smoothing percentage to 50%.
__label__positive Not all of the point sources that we model are indeed stars — our sample is inevitably contaminated by compact galaxies andquasars.
__label__positive We attempt to ﬁlter out galaxies by enforcing a compactness criterion on point sources (see Section 3), but at the faint end of our source catalog, this criterion becomes lesseffective, both because morphology of sources becomes moredifﬁcult to determine and because galaxies become morenumerous in relation to stars.
__label__positive There are also certain stellar types, such as O and B stars, that are not included in ourstellar template library.
__label__positive In order to ﬁlter out such sources, we make a goodness-of- ﬁt cut after modeling the stellar para- meters.
__label__positive In detail, we ﬁlter out stars for which the minimum χ 2/passband >5(i.e., for which no stellar template accurately models the observed photometry ).
__label__positive For the purposes of this cut, we count stellar parallax as an additional photometric band.
__label__positive In previous work, we cut on the Bayesian evidence of the modelfor each individual star.
__label__positive Our new cut is similar in spirit, but does not depend on the choice of priors, relying instead only on the likelihood.
__label__positive Approximately 1.4% of point sources fail thisgoodness-of- ﬁt cut, and are therefore not used to determine line-of-sight reddening.
__label__positive Single-sightline Inference In this section, we will describe how to use the stars within one individual pixel to infer the dust density as a function of distance.
__label__positive The way in which we do this for one isolated sightline is described in detail in Green et al.
__label__positive We split the sightline up into discrete distance bins, and parameterize the logarithm of the increase in reddening in thedistance bins by α.
__label__positive We want to know what distribution of dust along the line of sight and what choice of stellar types and distances are consistent with the observed stellar magnitudesand parallaxes.
__label__positive The posterior on the line-of-sight dust distribution is given by av v a a =pm p m p ,1,, 6 (∣ { ˆˆ} ) ( { ˆˆ}∣ ) ( ) ( ) where vm,{ˆˆ}denotes the photometry and parallaxes for all the stars in the sightline, and v =pm ,({ˆˆ} )is a constant for any given observed data.
__label__positive Assuming that the stars are independent,we get  av a v a = Îpm p p m ,1,.7 iii stars(∣ { ˆˆ} ) ( ) ( ˆˆ∣ ) ( ) The term ap()encodes our prior expectations about the amount of dust in each distance bin along the sightline.
__label__positive (2015,2018 ), we put a log-normal prior on the jump in reddening in each distance bin, based on a simple, smooth model of the distribution of dust in the Milky Way.
__label__positive InSection 2.3, we describe how to impose a prior that links the dust in nearby sightlines.
__label__positive In what follows, we will drop the subscript i, and it is assumed we are discussing a single star.
__label__positive We can expand this term as òva v ma m=Q Q pm pm d d,, , , 8(ˆˆ∣ ) ( ˆˆ∣ ) ( ) òvm a m m =Q Q Qpm p d d,, , , .
__label__positive 9(ˆˆ∣ )( ) () Note the similarity between the term in the integrand and the right-hand side of Equation (2).
__label__positive The observed stellar photometry and parallax are dependent only on the stellar type, distance, and reddening.
__label__positive Given a line-of-sight distribution of reddening, α, and stellar distance modulus, μ, we can calculate the stellar reddening, E.Table 2 Stellar Parameters Parameter Meaning Prior E Reddening Flat prior for E>0.

__label__positive This expression is generally quick to compute,once the precomputed stellar posteriors, mpE,i˜() , are available.
__label__positive We model the line-of-sight reddening as a step function, with αencoding the increase in reddening in each distance bin.
__label__positive The jumps in reddening are discretized as integer multiples of0.01 mag.
__label__positive The distance bins are spaced evenly in distance modulus, from μ=4 mag to 19 mag, with a bin spacing of 0.125 mag.
__label__positive 2014,2015,2018 ),w e ﬁnd that our discretized parameteriza- tion of reddening signi ﬁcantly speeds up the evaluation of the line integrals in Equation (14), as well as the convergence of our MCMC sampler.
__label__positive Correlated Prior In the previous section, we showed how to determine the distance-reddening relation along one isolated sightline.However, 3D dust maps created sightline-by-sightline display a number of undesirable and unphysical features.
__label__positive Because distance is fundamentally more dif ﬁcult to deter- mine than angular position on the sky, dust clouds in 3D dust maps constructed from individual sightlines are typically highly elongated in the radial direction.
__label__positive This is an unphysicalfeature that violates the Copernican principle.
__label__positive We mightreasonably expect, a priori, for dust clouds to be oriented randomly with respect to the Sun (or at least, to not be oriented in some special con ﬁguration with respect to the Sun ).
__label__positive Our technique for measuring the distribution of dust along the line of sight depends on bracketing the dust with foreground and background stars.
__label__positive Because of the stochasticnature of the distribution of stars throughout the Galaxy, a particular dust cloud may be tightly constrained in distance by foreground and background stars in one sightline, but poorlyconstrained in distance in a neighboring sightline.
__label__positive This leads to3D dust maps in which the precision of our distance estimate for the same cloud can vary signi ﬁcantly across different sightlines.
__label__positive A priori, we expect the dust density ﬁeld to be smooth on small scales, so that if a dust cloud appears at somedistance in one sightline, it is likely to appear at a similar distance in neighboring sightlines.
__label__positive In order to solve these problems, several works have suggested placing Gaussian process priors on either the dustreddening density (i.e., the derivative of reddening with distance )(Rezaei et al.
__label__positive 2017 ), or on the logarithm of the dust reddening density (Lallement et al.
__label__positive There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach.
__label__positive If dust reddening density is a Gaussian process, then line integrals through the reddening density are themselves Gaussian, meaning that the integrated reddenings to observedstars are a Gaussian process.
__label__positive (2018 )to avoid having to explicitly model the dust reddening density throughout space, but rather only theintegrated reddenings to observed stars.
__label__positive However, dust red-dening density cannot be negative and varies over severalorders of magnitude, from the diffuse interstellar medium todense molecular cores.
__label__positive For these reasons, modeling thelogarithm of the dust density as a Gaussian process is morephysically natural, and is the approach taken in this paper.
__label__positive Bothapproaches encode the expected smoothness of the dust densityﬁeld, and will tend to produce maps with round clouds, not stretched along the line of sight.
__label__positive The true interstellar medium isnot a Gaussian process, as it contains ﬁlamentary structure that is not fully described by a two-point correlation function, yet one may reasonably expect that a Gaussian process prior thatcorrelates dust density in nearby sightlines will produce morephysical results than a completely uncorrelated prior in whichneighboring sightlines are independent of one another.
__label__positive A thirdpossibility that is worth mentioning is to model the logarithmof the integrated extinction to each point in space as a Gaussian process ( Sale & Magorrian 2014 ).
__label__positive This has the advantage of being less computationally taxing than modeling the logarithmof the dust extinction density as a Gaussian process, but issomewhat less physical, as it does not encode our knowledgethat integrated extinction increases with distance —and it even allows negative extinction density.
__label__positive (2015,2018 ), we modeled the logarithm of the reddening density in each voxel (one distance bin in one sightline )as a Gaussian, with a mean given by the smooth disk component of the model of the Galaxy from Drimmel &Spergel (2001 ), and a ﬁxed variance in each bin.
__label__positive In this paper, we alter this prior by introducing covariances between thevoxels, including covariances between voxels in differentsightlines: aa a aa a¼~ ¼  K ,, , ,, ,; , 1 5 NN 12 12 (¯¯ ¯ )( ) where αkis the logarithm of the reddening density in a single voxel, Nis the total number of voxels (in multiple sightlines ), ak¯is the expectation of the logarithm of the reddening density in voxel k, given by a smooth Galactic model (the same as used in Green et al.
__label__positive The covariance between any two voxels is a function of the distancebetween their centers —this function is called the “kernel.
__label__positive ”The kernel contains information about the power spectrum of theinterstellar medium, and in principle could be derived fromphysical considerations (see, e.g., Sale & Magorrian (2014 ), who assume Kolmogorov turbulence in the interstellarmedium ), or parameterized and inferred itself (as in Leike & Enßlin (2019 )).
__label__positive In this work, we choose instead to ﬁx the 4The Astrophysical Journal, 887:93 (27pp ), 2019 December 10 Green et al.
__label__positive kernel, which reduces the computational complexity of the problem.
__label__positive In Section 2.2, we worked out the posterior density on reddening in a single sightline.
__label__positive With our new Gaussian processprior, the joint posterior density of reddening in many sightlines is similar to Equation (14):  òav a a ma mmµ¼ ´ ÎÎpm p pE d,, , ,, .
__label__positive 16N ni nii nii1 sightlines stars in({ } ∣ { ˆˆ} ) ( ) ˜( ( ) ) ()⎡ ⎣⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ The joint prior, aa¼p ,,N 1( ), is the Gaussian process prior over the logarithm of the reddening density in all the voxels in theentire volume under consideration, which spans multiplesightlines.
__label__positive Covariance Kernel In this section, we describe the kernel, which sets the covariance between the logarithm of the reddening density in any two voxels.
__label__positive We choose a modi ﬁed exponential kernel, for which covariance falls exponentially at large distances, butwhich smoothly asymptotes to a maximum value within distances rr 0.
__label__positive This effective inner radius limits the maximum covariance between any two voxels, which helpsto make the problem more computationally tractable.
__label__positive Let α k anda¢kbe the logarithm of the dust density in two different voxels, the respective centers of which lie at rkand¢rk, and let ¢rkkbe the physical distance between the centers of the voxels.
__label__positive Our kernel is given by s=- + +gg g¢¢rrKAℓrrr ℓ,e x p1,1 7 kkkk 02 01 0() ( ) ( )⎡ ⎣⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ where ℓis a distance scale over which the correlation between voxels decays, Ais the asymptotic value of the correlation coefﬁcient for small physical separations, r0is the inner radius at which the correlation begins to smoothly asymptotes to A, andγdeﬁnes how smoothly the cap is imposed.
__label__positive We set the variance in the logarithmic reddening density (i.e., the diagonal of the covariance matrix )tos02.
__label__positive This parameter thus sets the overall scale of variation in reddening from the smoothGalactic model.
__label__positive For =¢ rrkk (zero distance, representing the variance in a single voxel ), the kernel is de ﬁned to be s02.W e setσ0=1.6, which yields a prior with approximately the same mean and variance in the expected reddening per unit distanceas the prior chosen in Green et al.
__label__positive (2018 ), taking into account the increased distance resolution of our new map.
__label__positive For the remaining kernel parameters, we choose =ℓ1.5 pc , r0=0.75 pc, γ=4, and =-»A exp 1 2 0.6() .
__label__positive The scale length, ℓ, is chosen to be similar to the transverse distance between neighboring sightlines, with a typical angular separa-tion of 6 8, at a radial distance of 1 kpc, which comes to ∼ 2 pc.
__label__positive The inner radius, r0, is set so that the prior is not dominated by correlations between the nearest distance bins,which are separated by smaller transverse distances.
__label__positive Although large correlations between nearby voxels are, in theory, not a problem, they can pose dif ﬁculties for the iterative approach we develop in Section 2.3.3.
__label__positive We give a summary of our chosen kernel parameters in Table 5.2.3.2.
__label__positive Importance Sampling Our goal is to impose a correlated prior that links dust reddening densities across different sightlines.
__label__positive In order to dothis, one naively has to infer the dust reddening density in all voxels simultaneously.
__label__positive A naive approach would involve calculating the covariance matrix, K, between all of the voxels in the map, inverting it, and then using MCMC to sample theposterior density (Equation (16))of the logarithmic reddening densities in all the voxels.
__label__positive With millions of sightlines, each with∼100 distance bins, this would require us to invert an enormous covariance matrix, and then to sample from a space with hundreds of millions of parameters —a daunting task.
__label__positive One way of reducing this problem to a feasible one, which we employ in this work, is to infer the dust reddening density only on restricted patches of sky, rather than over the entire sky at once.
__label__positive This limits the size of the covariance matrix that mustbe calculated and inverted, and also decreases the dimension-ality of the parameter space that must be sampled.
__label__positive Rather than sampling from the reddening density over all voxels in the entire map simultaneously, we instead analyze small patches ofsky independently.
__label__positive A second technique one might try is importance sampling, which we will ﬂesh out here.
__label__positive In importance sampling, one wishes to sample from a distribution qp(), which might be expensive to compute.
__label__positive One begins instead by drawing points from a distribution that is easier to sample, which we will call q¢p().
__label__positive One then reweights each sample jby the ratio q q= ¢wp p,1 8 jj j() ()() termed the “importance weight.
__label__positive ”The weighted samples, qw,jj{() } , are then representative of the distribution qp().
__label__positive Importance sampling works well when the distribution q¢p()is a good approximation of the true distribution, qp().
__label__positive In such cases, the weights, w{}, will be close to unity.
__label__positive If q¢p()is a poor approximation to qp(), then the samples, q{}, will not be concentrated in the regions of high probability density qp(), and will therefore receive near-zero weights, while the few samples that happen to lie in regions of high probability density will receive large weights.

__label__positive 5The Astrophysical Journal, 887:93 (27pp ), 2019 December 10 Green et al.
__label__positive An Iterative Scheme for Imposing the Correlated Prior Our central idea here will be to ﬁrst sample from the uncorrelated case, and then over the course of severaliterations, to resample the individual pixels in a way that progressively yields a better approximation to our desired Gaussian process prior.
__label__positive Our iterative scheme begins by sampling from each sightline individually.
__label__positive For each sightline, n, we obtain samples of α n, the logarithm of the dust reddening density in all the distance bins along the line of sight.
__label__positive In order to update one sightline, we select a small patch of sky surrounding it.
__label__positive We will call the reddening density in thecentral sightline α n, and the reddening density in the neighboring sightlines an⧹.
__label__positive We resample the entire patch of sky, but treat the central sightline differently from theneighbors.
__label__positive The reddening pro ﬁle in each neighbor is repre- sented by a sample from the previous iteration, while thereddenings along central sightline are allowed to take on any value.
__label__positive The neighboring sightlines need only be resampled in order to impose the correct prior on the central sightline, andwe only store samples of the reddening density in the central sightline.
__label__positive We begin by initializing the reddening density in each neighboring sightline to a random sample from the previousiteration, and set the reddening density in the central sightline to an initial guess.
__label__positive We then alternate between updating the central and the neighboring sightlines.
__label__positive To update one sightline, holding all the others ﬁxed, we need to sample from the conditional distribution òav a a a ma mmµ ´ Îpm p pE d,, ,, , 2 2nn n n inii nii stars in(∣ { ˆˆ} ) ( ∣ ) ˜( ( ) ) ( )⧹⧹ where nis the sightline we are updating, and n⧹denotes the set of sightlines we are holding ﬁxed.
__label__positive One useful property of a multivariate Gaussian is that the conditional probabilitydensities are also Gaussian.
__label__positive If we ﬁx the sightlines n⧹, the conditional prior on sightline n,aapnn(∣ ) ⧹, is itself a Gaussian.
__label__positive To update the central sightline, we hold all the neighboring sightlines ﬁxed, and sample from the conditional distribution on the reddening in the central sightline.
__label__positive We use MCMCsampling to explore the space of reddening densities along the central sightline, holding the neighbors ﬁxed.
__label__positive To update each neighboring sightline, we hold all the other neighbors and the central sightline ﬁxed.
__label__positive We choose a new sample for the neighboring sightline, from the set of samples stored in the previous iteration.
__label__positive We wish the sample we draw to be distributedaccording to Equation (22), with nrepresenting the neighbor to be updated, and n⧹representing all the other sightlines.
__label__positive However, the stored samples of αnfrom the previous iteration are drawn from the posterior on αnin the previous iteration, which we will denote apn prev().
__label__positive We therefore have to weight each stored sample according to the ratio of the conditional probability density of that sample, Equation (22), to the posterior of that sample from the previous iteration: aav a a=wpm p,,.2 3 nnn n prev()(∣ { ˆˆ} ) ()()⧹This is essentially an importance-sampling step, with the conditional probability density (Equation (22))playing the role ofqpj()and the stored posterior density of the sample from the previous iteration playing the role of q¢pj()in Equation (18).
__label__positive The details of how we calculate the ratio of these probabilitydensities are given in Appendix B.
__label__positive The importance-sampling step for the neighboring sightlines works well as long as the samples stored from the previousiteration are a decent representation of the conditional probability density of each neighbor, holding all the other neighbors and the central sightline ﬁxed.
__label__positive If we adiabatically change the correlated prior from iteration to the next, then this is generally the case.
__label__positive In each iteration, we jointly sample all the sightlines in a small patch surrounding the central sightline, alternating between updating the central sightline and updating each neighbor.
__label__positive We assess convergence by monitoring the auto-correlation of the reddening in the central sightline, as detailed in Appendix D.
__label__positive In order to speed up convergence, we use a technique that is similar to parallel tempering, with anensemble of samplers that explore modi ﬁed versions of the joint posterior on reddening density (see Appendix C).
__label__positive Details of our implementation are discussed in Appendix E.
__label__positive The method presented here makes a number of approxima- tions to the Gaussian process model.
__label__positive First, it only takes into account correlations between voxels that are at close angular separations on the sky, as seen from the solar system, therebygiving the Sun a somewhat special position in our priors.
__label__positive Second, our voxels are highly elongated along the radial direction, and we calculate the distances between voxels usingthe distances between their centers.
__label__positive For this reason, distancesbetween voxels are much smaller in the transverse directions than in the radial direction, and the correlations are correspond- ingly stronger along the transverse directions.
__label__positive We treat thecorrelations along the radial direction heuristically, through a modiﬁcation of the inverse covariance matrix, as explained in Appendix C.
__label__positive Nevertheless, this method provides a relatively computationally inexpensive way to approximately apply a Gaussian Process prior to our map.
__label__positive It also provides a signiﬁcantly improved result, as will be shown in the following.
__label__positive Data 3.1.Gaia The European Space Agency ’sGaia spacecraft aims to map the 3D positions and kinematics —as well as spectral types —of a substantial fraction of Milky Way stars (Gaia Collaboration et al.
__label__positive The mission will eventually provide astrometry (positions, proper motions, and parallaxes )and optical spectro- photometry for over a billion stars (Liu et al.
__label__positive 2012 ), as well as radial velocity measurements of more than 100 million stars (Katz et al.
__label__positive Gaia DR2 contains ﬁve-parameter astrometric determinations for 1.3 billion sources (Lindegren et al.
__label__positive Gaia’s spectrophotometry is an unusual middle ground between many-band photometry and low-resolution spectrosc-opy.
__label__positive Gaia takes dispersed images of sources in two bands, RP (330–680 nm )and BP (630–1050 nm ).
__label__positive 2018 )provides integrated RP and BP photometry of 1.4 billion sources, which Andrae et al.

__label__positive effective temperatures for 161 million stars and reddenings for 88 million stars.
__label__positive In future data releases, low-resolution RP andBP spectra will allow better characterization of the parameters of bright stars.
__label__positive For our work here, the most valuable data set provided by Gaia DR2 consists of the stellar parallax measurements.
__label__positive Parallaxes provide an independent means of estimating stellar distances from template ﬁtting of spectral energy distributions.
__label__positive Particularly for bright and for nearby stars, Gaia parallaxes canconstrain stellar distance much better than photometry alone.
__label__positive Stellar distance-reddening posterior densities based on photo- metry are often bimodal, as main-sequence and giant stars ofthe same temperature can lie at vastly different distances.
__label__positive Even relatively uncertain parallaxes can be suf ﬁcient to break this degeneracy; see Figure 1 of Zucker et al.
__label__positive We make two quality cuts on the Gaia DR2 catalog recommended by Arenou et al.
__label__positive (2018 ): > •_ _ 8 , 2 4 () visibility periods used c-< •__ __ _ _ 5, 25threshold2 ()astrometric chi2 al astrometric n good obs al wherecthreshold2is related to the Gaia G -band magnitude, mG, by c=- - m 1.44 max 1, exp 0.4 19.5 .
__label__positive 26 G threshold2{ [ ( )]} ( ) Theﬁrst of these cuts removes sources with an insuf ﬁcient number of Gaia observations to safely make a parallax measurement, while the second cut removes sources that arepoorly ﬁt by the astrometric model (and is essentially a cut on reduced χ 2).
__label__positive Pan-STARRS 1 The bulk of our stellar photometry comes from the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 (Pan-STARRS 1, hereafter abbreviated as “PS1”), a 1.8 m optical and near-infrared telescope located on Mount Halea- kala, Hawaii (Chambers et al.
__label__positive The telescope is equipped with the Gigapixel Camera #1(GPC1 ), consisting of an array of 60 CCD detectors, each 4800 pixels on a side (Tonry et al.
__label__positive From 2010 May to 2014 April, the majority of the observing time wasdedicated to a multiepoch survey of the sky north of decl.
__label__positive 2016, named the “3πsurvey ”for its footprint in steradians ).
__label__positive The 3 πsurvey observed in four SDSS-like passbands (York et al.
__label__positive 2000 ), gP1,rP1,iP1, andzP1,a s well as an additional passband in the near-infrared, yP1.
__label__positive The entire ﬁlter set spans the range 400 –1000 nm (Stubbs et al.
__label__positive Astrometry and photometry was extracted by the PS1 Image Processing Pipeline (Magnier et al.
__label__positive PS1 photometry features a very uniform ﬂux calibration, achieving better than 1% precision over the sky (Schla ﬂy et al.
__label__positive In single-epoch photometry, the 3 π survey reaches typical 5 σdepths of 22.0 mag (AB )ingP1, 21.8 mag in rP1, 21.5 mag in iP1, 20.9 mag in zP1, and 19.7 mag inyP1(Chambers et al.
__label__positive The PS1 Data Release 1 (DR1 ) occurred in 2016 December.
__label__positive It provided a static-sky catalog,stacked images from the 3 πsurvey, and other data products (Flewelling et al.
__label__positive 2016 ).Because of its large footprint, homogeneous depth, and excellent internal calibration, PS1 photometry provides an idealdata set for mapping Galactic dust through stellar colors.
__label__positive (2018 ), we use stellar photometry derived from the single-epoch photometry, which is very similar to PS1 DR1,with the primary difference being in the treatment ofobservations taken in nonphotometric conditions.
__label__positive Two Micron All-sky Survey The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS )is an all-sky survey in three near-infrared passbands, J,H,a n d K s(Skrutskie et al.
__label__positive 2006 ), conducted from two 1.3 m telescopes at Mount Hopkins, Arizona and Cerro Tololo, Chile.
__label__positive The name ofthe survey derives from the wavelength range covered by the reddest passband, K s.
__label__positive Ground-based surveys beyond the atmo- spheric window at 2 μm are hampered by severe background thermal emission (Skrutskie et al.
__label__positive The focal plane of each telescope was equipped with three 256 ×256 pixel arrays, with a2 ′pixel scale.
__label__positive The entire sky was covered six times with dual 51 ms and 1.3 s exposures, in order to cover a wide range inapparent magnitudes.
__label__positive The survey achieved a 10 σpoint-source depth of ∼15.8,∼15.1, and ∼14.3 mag (Vega )inJ,H,a n d K s, respectively.
__label__positive The 2MASS photometry was calibrated to0.02 mag accuracy, with per-source photometric uncertainties for bright sources below 0.03 mag (Skrutskie et al.
__label__positive (2018 ), we make use of the “high-reliability catalog ”6and exclude sources that are marked as possibly having contamination from nearby point sources or galaxies.
__label__positive Input Catalog We generate a matched input catalog combining PS1 grizy photometry, 2MASS JHK sphotometry and Gaia parallaxes, using the Large Survey Database framework (Juric 2012 ).W e use a matching radius of 1 ″to match 2MASS sources to PS1, and a radius of 0 2 to match Gaia DR2 sources to PS1.
__label__positive We require that each source be observed in at least four photometricpassbands, at least two of which must be from PS1.
__label__positive We do notrequire that sources have measured parallaxes.
__label__positive To exclude extended sources, we require that the -<mm 0.1 PSF apˆˆ in at least two PS1 bands, where mPSFˆ are magnitudes determined using PSF photometry, and mapˆare aperture magnitudes.
__label__positive Our resulting catalog contains 799 million sources, of which 19.5% are observed in at least one 2MASS passband, 62.4% have aGaia parallax measurement, and 8.6% have a Gaia parallax measurement with vs>v 5 ˆ .
__label__positive It should be noted, however, that even parallax measurements that do not con ﬁdently rule out zero parallax can put useful lower limits on distance.
__label__positive In our input catalog, 32.4% of sources are constrained at s>2by their Gaia parallaxes to be more distant than 1 kpc.
__label__positive We divide up the sky using a multiresolution HEALPix pixelization (Gorski et al.
__label__positive We assign the sources to angular pixels in the same manner as in Green et al.
__label__positive (2018 ), beginning with a coarse angular pixelization of the sky andrecursively subdividing pixels with more than a given number of sources.
__label__positive Given that our spatially correlated priors allow information to be shared between nearby voxels, we subdividepixels more aggressively than in Green et al.

__label__positive resulting in 4.21 million pixels (versus 3.42 million over the same footprint in our previous work ).
__label__positive The properties of our input catalog are summarized in Tables 3and4.
__label__positive In order to estimate the level of galaxy and quasar contamination in our sample at high Galactic latitudes (b>85°), we match our source catalog to unWISE W1-band photometry (Schla ﬂye ta l .
__label__positive Due to thermal dust emission in galaxies and quasars, these objects are redder than stars in -zW P1 1 .
__label__positive We use this fact to estimate that 3.2% of sources that make their way into our line-of-sight dust analysis at b>85°are galaxies or quasars.
__label__positive See Appendix Gfor a more detailed explanation of this analysis.
__label__positive While we ﬁnd a relatively low level of contamination, this analysis demonstrates that WISE photo- metry is an effective tool for cleaning out contamination from galaxies and quasars, and will be important in the creation of high-quality dust corrections for use in extra-Galactic astronomy.
__label__positive Results We obtain a map of dust reddening density, with angular sightlines of a typical scale of 3 4–137, and 120 distance binsspaced logarithmically in distance from 63 pc to 63 kpc (although the map rarely contains information to this distance, particularly in the heavily obscured Galactic plane ).
__label__positive Figures 1–4show differential reddening in four distance ranges, out to 5 kpc, while Figure 5shows the cumulative reddening out to the maximum distance in the map.
__label__positive Our map isprobabilistic, and we obtain samples of the reddening density in each voxel.
__label__positive In order to transform this into a single value for plotting purposes, we ﬁrst construct a map of median integrated reddening out to each voxel.
__label__positive When we wish to display reddening densities, we use the line-of-sight derivative of this“median ”map.
__label__positive Figures 1–4reveal a wealth of structure at different scales and at different distances.
__label__positive The nearest dust structures appear off of the Galactic plane in Figure 1: Orion, Taurus, Perseus, California, the Aquila Rift, and ρOphiuchus.
__label__positive In Figure 2, Monoceros R2 and Cygnus X are clearly visible.
__label__positive At increasing distances, in Figures 3and4, dust features are increasingly conﬁned to low Galactic latitude, as should be expected for the Galactic disk.
__label__positive Figure 6shows an estimate of the maximum distance to which our map reliably traces dust.
__label__positive This estimate is based on the distance at which we run out of main-sequence stars (deﬁned as the distance beyond which we infer there to be 10 stars with >M 4m a grP1 in our input catalog for a given sightline ).
__label__positive The maximum reliable depth varies from hundreds of parsecs to more than 10 kpc, depending on stellar density throughout the Galaxy (larger at lower Galactic latitudes ), the presence of dense dust clouds that obscure background stars,Table 3 Input Catalog Source Statistics % Sources Detected % Sources Detected in in Each Band NPhotometric Bands Band % N % gP1 79.0 4 29.1 rP1 98.1 5 52.5 iP1 97.0 6 4.7 zP1 98.0 7 5.0 yP1 93.8 8 8.7 J 18.5 LL H 15.5 LL KS 11.6 LL ϖ 62.4 LL ϖ/σϖ>5 8.6 LL ϖ+2σϖ<1 mas 32.4 LL 799 million sources total.Table 4 Pixelization of the Sky nside Pixel Max.

__label__positive Our ﬁnal data product contains both the estimated maximum reliable distance,as well as a minimum reliable distance (deﬁned as the distance within which we infer there to be two main-sequence stars in our input catalog for a given sightline ).
__label__positive Dependence on Correlation Length The Gaussian process prior, which couples the reddening density in nearby voxels, has a signi ﬁcant impact on the recovered reddening map.
__label__positive We can see this by comparing the results from the ﬁrst iteration, in which the sightlines are independent, and the ﬁnal iteration, in which the sightlines are coupled, as shown in Figure 7.
__label__positive The correlated prior favors dust clouds that are isotropic, rather than stretched along theline of sight.
__label__positive As the transverse distance between neighboringsightlines grows with distance, the correlations between themare stronger in the nearest distance bins than in the farthest distance bins.
__label__positive The effect of our Gaussian process prior is thus greatest for the nearest clouds, particularly within a distanceof∼1k p c .
__label__positive The effect of the Gaussian process prior can be seen in a striking way in close-up views of individual clouds.
__label__positive Figure 8 shows the reddening density in our correlated and uncorrelated maps (corresponding to the ﬁnal and initial iterations, respectively )in the vicinity of the Orion B molecular cloud complex.
__label__positive The distance to the cloud complex is much betterlocalized in the correlated map, whereas in the uncorrelatedmap, the dust is spread over a wider range of distances.
__label__positive Slices through the dust density ﬁeld in the uncorrelated map show holes, caused by the model placing the cloud complex atdifferent distances in neighboring sightlines.
__label__positive The results for Orion B are typical of our results for clouds within 1 kpc.
__label__positive Maximum reliable distance to which we trace dust, based on our estimate of the distance at which we run out of main-sequence stars in each sightline.
__label__positive The sharp boundaries that run ∼10–25°above and below the Galactic plane correspond to the boundaries at which we switch the angular scale of our sightlines.
__label__positive We generally trace dust to greater distances near the Galactic midplane, where the stellar number density is larger, except in regions where dense cloud s block background stars.
__label__positive The arc of increased maximum distance at b−45°in the outer Galaxy corresponds to the Sagittarius stream.

__label__positive Comparison with 2D Dust Map: Planck Collaboration et al.
__label__positive (2014 ) Although we infer dust reddening in 3D voxels, we can compare our results with those of 2D dust maps by integratingout the distance direction in our map.
__label__positive In the following, we use the median of our integrated reddening at each location on the sky.
__label__positive (2014, hereafter “Planck14 ,”)ﬁts a modiﬁed blackbody model of dust emission to the Planck 857, 545, and 353 GHz bands, as well as the IRAS 100 μm band.
__label__positive Planck14 then constructs two different maps of dust reddening by separately calibrating optical depth at 353 GHz and integrated radiance against reddening measurements of SDSSquasars.
__label__positive While far-infrared optical depth should be a better tracer of dust reddening than integrated radiance is, at high Galactic latitude, optical depth estimates can be noisy due to covariancesbetween the dust optical depth, temperature, and β(which describes the shape of the modi ﬁed blackbody spectrum ).I n these comparisons, we therefore use the reddenings derived fromintegrated radiance, which we denote as .
__label__positive We transform these reddenings from -EBV() to-Egr() using the RV=3.1 reddening curve of Schla ﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011 ).
__label__positive In Figure 9, we compare our map to the Planck radiance- based dust map out of the Galactic midplane (>b 15 ∣∣ ).
__label__positive In the midplane of the Galaxy, we would expect Planck to detect dustout to greater extinctions, as dust remains optically thin in far- infrared emission.
__label__positive By contrast, our method relies on observing stars behind the dust, and therefore cannot trace reddening to asgreat a depth.
__label__positive We compare the Planck14 map with both theinitial iteration of our dust map, without spatially correlated priors, and the ﬁnal iteration of our dust map, which has spatially correlated priors.
__label__positive For both versions of the map, weﬁnd good agreement with Planck14 , out to a reddening of -»Egr 1m a g () , with median residuals between the maps of0.05 mag.
__label__positive At reddenings of -Egr 0.1 mag () , the ﬁnal iteration of our map (with correlated spatial priors )matches Planck14 better than the initial iteration does (with completely independent sightlines ), in that the residuals have a ﬂat trend with increasing reddening.
__label__positive At these low reddenings, the trends in the residuals between the two maps are driven by possible zero-point offsetsin both maps, as well as the details of the priors we impose onthe dust reddening.
__label__positive The introduction of the correlated spatial prior on dust reddening density should act to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in our reddening measurements, as thereddening in each sightline is in ﬂuenced by stars in nearby sightlines.
__label__positive If our prior favors too much reddening at high Galactic latitudes, then increased signal-to-noise should driveour reddening measurements down —and closer to the correct answer.
__label__positive (2018 ) In Figure 10, we compare our integrated reddenings at large distance (for both the initial and ﬁnal iterations of our map ) with those of Green et al.
__label__positive (2018, hereafter “Bayestar17 ”).A t reddenings greater than -~Egr 0.1 mag () , our results are Figure 7.
__label__positive A face-on view of the Galaxy, with the Sun at the center.
__label__positive The right of each panel corresponds to b=0°, and the Galactic center lies off the right edge of the plot.
__label__positive The left panel shows the initial iteration, without a spatially correlated prior on dust reddening density, while the right panel shows the ﬁnal iteration, with a correlation length of 1.5 pc.
__label__positive We integrate the reddening from z=−300 pc to +300 pc.
__label__positive As is evident from a comparison of the two panels, the correlated prior yields more isotropic cloud shapes, with less smearing along the line of sight.
__label__positive This effect is especially pronounced at nearby distances, where neighboring sightlines are more tightly coupled.
__label__positive 11The Astrophysical Journal, 887:93 (27pp ), 2019 December 10 Green et al.
__label__positive largely consistent, with median residuals of 0.02 mag out to a reddening of -»Egr 1m a g () .
__label__positive The major differences between the initial iteration and Bayestar17 are the use of Gaia parallaxes in the former, as well as slightly different extinction vectors (particularly in the 2MASS passbands )and additional distance bins in the former, which has the effect of slightly altering our priors.
__label__positive In the ﬁnal iteration of our dust map, regions of the sky with low reddening differ mostfrom Bayestar17 (and from the initial iteration ), with more of the sky being placed at the lowest reddenings.
__label__positive The spatially correlated priors effectively cause information to be sharedbetween nearby voxels.
__label__positive If the stellar photometry in one voxelconstrains the reddening to be close to zero, this information propagates to the neighboring voxels, pulling down the inferred reddening.
__label__positive If the priors on individual voxels at high Galacticlatitude favor more dust than is typically found in these regions, Figure 8.
__label__positive The left column shows the results from the ﬁnal iteration, with a correlation length of 1.5 pc.
__label__positive The center column shows the results from the initial, uncorrelated iteration, while the right column shows the difference between the ﬁnal and initial iterations.
__label__positive Dust clouds have fewer “holes ”when the correlated prior is applied, and are better localized in distance.
__label__positive Note that in the correlated iteration, we localize the distance of Orion B much more precisely, while in the uncorrelated iteration, it is smeared across a greater range of distances.
__label__positive 12The Astrophysical Journal, 887:93 (27pp ), 2019 December 10 Green et al.
__label__positive then the introduction of spatially correlated priors will tend to pull these regions closer to the true reddening.
__label__positive (2019, hereafter “Chen19 ”)uses stellar parallax measurements from Gaia DR2, as well as optical and near-infraredphotometry from Gaia,WISE , and 2MASS to trace dust reddening in the Galactic plane (<b 10 ∣∣ ).I nF i g u r e 11, we compare our m a pw i t ht h a to f Chen19 .
__label__positive Due to our use of deeper Pan-STARRS 1 photometry, we trace dust den sity to greater distances.
__label__positive The greater distance resolution of our map also reveals much ﬁner features.
__label__positive This greater distance resolution is enabled in part by ourlarger input catalog (799 million versus 56 million stars ).

__label__positive features revealed by both maps are similar, increasing our conﬁdence that both maps are recovering real features in the interstellar medium.
__label__positive Neither map shows clear spiral structure —we discuss the possible relation of the features in our map to spiral structure in Section 4.4.
__label__positive Leike & En ßlin (2019 ) Leike & Enßlin (2019, hereafter “LE2019 ”)reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of nearby dust using Gaia DR2 parallaxes and reddening estimates (the latter from Andrae et al.
__label__positive (2018 )), treating the logarithm of the dust density as aGaussian process.
__label__positive LE2019 apply their model to 3.7 million stars with well-determined Gaia parallaxes in a 600 pc3( )cube centered on the Sun, obtaining the three-dimensional distribu- tion of dust, as well as its spatial correlation spectrum.
__label__positive There are a number of important differences between our present work and that of LE2019 .
__label__positive Unlike in our work, LE2019 uses a hierarchical Bayesian model in which the kernel parameters are inferred, rather than ﬁxed beforehand.
__label__positive Their resulting correlation kernel has correlations on much largerscales than the kernel we assume, on the order of 30 pc.LE2019 uses a constant mean in their Gaussian process prior over all of their volume.

__label__positive a smooth Galactic disk, encoding our prior expectations about the overall structure of the Galaxy.
__label__positive A key difference between our methods is that, in the present work, we approximate the Gaussian process prior in small angular patches surrounding each sightline, disregarding correlations between voxels that are separated by more than ∼22′in angle on the sky.
__label__positive At a distance of 300 pc, this means that our prior ties voxels that are separated by a maximum physical distance of ∼1.9 pc.
__label__positive This produces more spherical clouds than one would get with an uncorrelated prior (see Figure 7), but does not fully exploit the information that is available in spatial correlations between nearby voxels.
__label__positive One consequence of this treatment is that some of the nearest clouds, such as the ρOphiuchi and Taurus cloud complexes, are placed somewhat farther away in our map than they are generally taken to be.
__label__positive (2019 ), who use a method that is more carefully tailored toward estimating the distance to individual clouds, obtain closer distances to these nearby cloudsthan does the map presented here, due to the greater number of stars per sightline and different priors used by Zucker et al.
__label__positive In Figure 12, we compare orthographic projections of our map and LE2019 .
__label__positive In Figure 13, we compare our map to that ofLE2019 in a Sun-centered stereographic projection of the Galactic anticentral region.
__label__positive These comparisons highlight the differences between our methods.
__label__positive As is visible in the orthographic projections, LE2019 produces more spherical dust structures, due partially to the fact that it uses Cartesian voxels, while we use voxels that are elongated in the radial direction.
__label__positive As is visible in the Sun-centered projection, however, our map has much ﬁner angular resolution, due to the much larger number of stars that enter into our analysis.
__label__positive Because we do notrequire well-constrained (or indeed, any )Gaia parallaxes in our method, we are able to take into account a far larger number ofstars, particularly at larger distances, where Gaia parallaxes become unavailable.
__label__positive The voxels in LE2019 are approximately 2.3 pc on a side, limiting the angular resolution that is achieved by their method, at present.
__label__positive Our map tends to capture morelow-reddening dust structure than LE2019 —as can be seen, for example, in the bottom right of Figure 13.
__label__positive This may be due to the greater number of stars that go into our map, to the qualityof our input stellar reddening estimates, or to differences in thechoice of priors.
__label__positive Spiral Structure Widely differing models of the spiral structure of the Milky Way have been proposed, with between two and four arms(Georgelin & Georgelin 1976; Drimmel 2000; Vallée 2008; Reid et al.
__label__positive 2009; Hou & Han 2014 ), and with or without a “molecular ring ”at 4 kpc from the Galactic center (Stecker et al.
__label__positive 1975; Cohen & Thaddeus 1977; Dobbs & Burkert 2012 ).
__label__positive Spiral structure should be apparent not only in 3D maps of theGalaxy, but also in the distribution of interstellar gas and star-forming regions in position –velocity space (see, e.g., Figure 3 of Dame et al.
__label__positive Though spiral structure is not readily visible in bird ’s-eye views of our map (see Figures 7and11), we can test whether the dust in our map preferentially fallsalong models of spiral arms developed using both position andvelocity information.

__label__positive In Figure 14, we compare parallax distances to these HMSFRs with our dust map.Visually, the HMSFRs preferentially lie in regions of higherdust density, as expected.

__label__positive we compare two Poisson point process models for the distribution of HMSFRs from Xu et al.
__label__positive The masers are independently and uniformly distributed in space.
__label__positive The masers are independently distributed proportionally to the dust reddening density.
__label__positive We carry out this analysis in a ﬁxed box, de ﬁned by <x 3 kpc ∣∣ ,<y 3 kpc ∣∣ ,<z 150 pc ∣∣ in a Cartesian repre- sentation of Solar-centered Galactic coordinates, excluding regions south of a decl.

__label__positive We ﬁnd a likelihood ratio of ~exp 27(), favoring the model in which the masers are distributedaccording to the reddening density.
__label__positive Masers in high-mass star-forming regions (Xu et al.

__label__positive The masers are colored according to the spiral arm to which they are assigned by Xu et al.
__label__positive (2016 ): the Perseus Arm in orange, the Local Arm in yellow, the Sagittarius Arm in purple, the Scutum Arm in turquoise, and all others in black.
__label__positive The distances are calculated naively as the inverse of parallax.
__label__positive 16The Astrophysical Journal, 887:93 (27pp ), 2019 December 10 Green et al.
__label__positive We test that the correlation between dust density and maser position is not due to the large-scale distribution of dust and masers (e.g., dust density generally being larger toward the inner Galaxy and HMSFRs also lying preferentially in thisdirection ), but rather correlations between smaller-scale features and maser positions.
__label__positive We do so by adding a small random displacement to the position of each maser (±300 pc in xandy, and±10 pc in z), which should reduce any correlations between small-scale features but keep correlations betweenlarge-scale features intact.
__label__positive Comparing the likelihood ratio inEquation (27)for many realizations of scattered maser positions to the likelihood ratio with the measured maser positions, we ﬁnd that the measured maser positions lead to a higher ratio in greater than 99% of cases, indicating that themaser positions are correlated with small-scale features inour map.
__label__positive Finally, we ﬁt a Poisson point process model to the maser locations in which the masers are distributed according to thedensity rr+r0 () , withrr()again being the inferred dust reddening density in our “median ”3D dust map, and ρ0being a free parameter that sets a ﬂoor on the maser abundance.
__label__positive The likelihood of this model is maximized when ρ0satisﬁes årr r r+= á ñ + =--rN1.2 8 iN i 101 01[() ] ( ) ( ) With the Xu et al.
__label__positive (2016 )maser positions in the same volume as used above, we ﬁnd thatr r »á ñ0.1450 .
__label__positive The uniform ﬂoor is thus low compared to the average dust density, again indicatingthat the HMSFRs largely follow the dust density inferred in our3D dust map.
__label__positive Despite the correlation between our inferred dust density and the locations of HMSFRs, visual inspection of our dust mapdoes not, in itself, reveal obvious evidence of spiral structure.
__label__positive This could be due to a number of factors, among them: 1.
__label__positive Our dust map does not extend beyond a few kiloparsecs.
__label__positive The overall spiral structure of our Galaxy might not beapparent on this scale.
__label__positive The spiral structure may be less apparent in dust than in the distribution of star-forming r egions, particularly on small scales.
__label__positive This is the case in many external spiral galaxies,where the dust density can show complicated structure, with spurs and ﬁlaments connecting spiral arms.Linear features in our map —for example, the feature running largely along the Local Arm in Figure 14—may correspond to spiral arms and spurs, but a dust map that extends to largerdistances will be necessary to see any possible curvature in these features, which one would expect if they correspond to spiral arms.
__label__positive In particular, pushing deeper into the inner Galaxymay allow us to gain a better view of the overall structure of the Milky Way.
__label__positive Doing so will require deeper photometry in the near-infrared than is provided by 2MASS.
__label__positive Stellar Parameter Catalog Inferring stellar distances, reddenings, and types (absolute rP1-band magnitude and [Fe/H])is a necessary ﬁrst step toward generating a 3D map of reddening, as described in Section 2.1.
__label__positive We save samples of these stellar parameters, and make them available along with our 3D reddening map.
__label__positive In order to validate the accuracy of our stellar reddening estimates, we comparethem to those estimated by Queiroz et al.
__label__positive (2018 )(hereafter, “StarHorse ”), which are based on APOGEE DR14 spectrosc- opy (Abolfathi et al.
__label__positive 2018 ), 2MASS JHK sphotometry, APASS DR9 BVg ′r′i′photometry (Henden & Munari 2014 ), and Gaia DR1 parallaxes and G-band photometry.
__label__positive We also compare our stellar reddenings to those of Andrae et al.
__label__positive (2018 )(hereafter, “Andrae2018 ”), which are based on Gaia DR2 parallaxes and G-band, BP, and RP photometry.
__label__positive Left panel: residuals of individual stellar extinctions, in units of AV, obtained by our method and those obtained by StarHorse .
__label__positive The x-axis uses the inverse- variance –weighted mean of the two reddening estimates.
__label__positive The blue envelopes show the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles of the residuals, as a function of AV.

__label__positive These uncertainties include the systematic error ﬂoors determined by comparison with extinctions inferred by StarHorse .
__label__positive 17The Astrophysical Journal, 887:93 (27pp ), 2019 December 10 Green et al.
__label__positive We ﬁrst match our stellar reddening catalog to that ofAndrae2018 using Gaia DR2source _id, excluding stars for which the best- ﬁtχ2/passband >5 for our stellar model.
__label__positive We convert ourreddening estimates, which are in the arbitrary unit E,t o -Egr() using the relation -=Eg r E 0.901 mag , 29 () ( ) ( ) as implied by the extinction coef ﬁcients in Table 1.
__label__positive We then match our combined catalog to the StarHorse APOGEE DR14 catalog using a matching radius of 0 2, obtaining a catalog of 5350 stars.
__label__positive In order to compare these catalogs on a uniform scale, we have to convert them to the same unit of reddening orextinction.
__label__positive In order to do this, we ﬁt a linear relationship between the StarHorse A Vestimates and our -Egr() estimates, and a separate linear relationship between StarHorse AVand the Andrae2018 estimates of -EBP RP() .
__label__positive (2010 ), we also ﬁt nuisanceparameters describing whether each star is an outlier and the overall distribution of outliers.
__label__positive We additionally ﬁt a systematic error ﬂoor for our -Egr() estimates and for Andrae2018 ʼs -EBP RP() estimates, assuming that the uncertainties reported by StarHorse are accurately estimated.
__label__positive The details of this model are described in Appendix F.
__label__positive We obtain the relations -= +Eg r A 0.269 0.03 mag, 30V,StarHorse () ( ) -= +EB P R P A 0.294 0.11 mag, 31V,StarHorse () ( ) with a systematic error ﬂoor of 0.08 mag on our -Egr() estimates, and a systematic error ﬂoor of 0.09 mag on theAndrae2018 -EBP RP() estimates.
__label__positive With these relations, we are able to transform between the three reddeningmeasurements and compare them on a common scale.
__label__positive The leftpanel of Figure 15shows the residual stellar A Vrecovered by our method and by StarHorse , as a function of AV, while the right panel shows the comparison between Andrae2018 andStarHorse (likewise in AV).A s StarHorse makes use of spectroscopically determined stellar atmospheric parameters, Figure 17.

__label__positive 18The Astrophysical Journal, 887:93 (27pp ), 2019 December 10 Green et al.
__label__positive its extinction estimates are generally much more precise than those produced by our method or by Andrae2018 .
__label__positive The residuals in Figure 15are thus dominated by errors in our measurements (in the left panel )or in Andrae2018 ʼs measure- ments (in the right panel ).
__label__positive As can be seen from these panels, the errors in our stellar extinction estimates are generally smallerthan those of Andrae2018 , due to the greater number of photometric passbands used in our study (up to eight, versus two ).
__label__positive In Figure 16, we directly compare the uncertainties in stellar reddening inferred by our method and Andrae2018 , for the 41.3 sources in our matched catalog, with the recoveredsystematic error ﬂoors added in quadrature.
__label__positive In -Egr() , the 95th percentile of the reddening uncertainties is 0.11 mag forour estimates, and 0.27 mag for the Andrae2018 estimates.
__label__positive In this matched catalog, our median uncertainty is 0.086 mag,30% less than the median uncertainty of 0.124 mag inAndrae2018 .
__label__positive These represent the typical uncertainties that can be expected for relatively bright stars with well-measuredGaia parallaxes.
__label__positive However, we obtain individual stellar red- dening estimates for all 799 million stars in our input catalog,including those without Gaia parallax measurements.
__label__positive We make this entire catalog available to the community, as described inSection 6.
__label__positive Figures 17shows the spatial distribution of stars in our catalog, excluding those with poor goodness-of- ﬁt(maximum- likelihood χ 2/passband >5).
__label__positive This distribution is determined by the true number density of stars throughout the Galaxy, the sensitivities of the PS1, 2MASS, and Gaia surveys, our selection function, and the distribution of interstellar dust.
__label__positive With a goodunderstanding of the latter confounding effects, this catalog can be used as a basis for determining the true distribution of stars throughout the Galaxy.
__label__positive Figure 18shows the distribution of stars with absolute rP1magnitudes 0 <Mr<1 and distances that are determined to better than 20%.
__label__positive Although a detailed treatment of selection functions is necessary to determine the structure of the Galaxy, the Galactic bulge is visible as an increase in stellardensity near the Galactic center in the projection to the xy,() plane.
__label__positive Because the boundary of the PS1 survey passes essentially through the Galactic center, the bulge appears off-center fromthe Galactic center.
__label__positive The relative lack of stars directly in theGalactic midplane (z=0)is due to dust obscuration, while the Figure 18.

__label__positive Each panel shows a projection of the stellar number density, on an arbitrary logarithmic scale.
__label__positive For these relatively bright stars, the Galactic bulge is apparent as a region of increased number density near the Galactic center (which is marked by a cross ).
__label__positive 19The Astrophysical Journal, 887:93 (27pp ), 2019 December 10 Green et al.
__label__positive lack of bright stars close to the Sun is due to saturation in photometric surveys.
__label__positive This catalog will serve as a basis for futurework on the structure of our Galaxy.
__label__positive Discussion The work presented here can be extended in a number of ways, both through improvements of the model as well as incorporationof more data.
__label__positive One methodological improvement would be to optimize the kernel parameters in the spatial prior.
__label__positive In this work, we have demonstrated that the incorporation of a Gaussianprocess prior on the logarithm of the dust reddening density yields signiﬁcant improvements in the effec tive distance resolution of the map, with cloud distances becoming much more precise.However, the kernel that we impose is determined beforehand, rather than inferred from the data.
__label__positive An optimized kernel would allow us to extract more information about the dust reddeningdensity from our data.
__label__positive As Leike & Enßlin (2019 )show, with an optimized kernel, it is possible to extract a signi ﬁcant amount of information about the spatial d istribution of dust from even relatively small stellar catalogs (3.7 million stars, albeit with well- determined parallaxes, versus ∼800 million in this work ).A n additional improvement to the method here would be to take into account larger patches of sky sur rounding each sightline, in order to better approximate the target Gaussian process prior.
__label__positive This is particularly important in the near regime, in which our angular patches correspond to smaller phys ical extent.
__label__positive Finally, although we increase the number of distanc eb i n si nt h i sw o r kb yaf a c t o ro f four over Green et al.
__label__positive (2018 ), our voxels are still elongated in the radial direction.
__label__positive This corresponds to the fundamental fact that wehave much better knowledge of th e angular distribution of dust than of its distribution with dista nce, but it makes implementation of spatially correlated priors —particularly those that obey the Copernican principle —more dif ﬁcult.
__label__positive A separate area in which signi ﬁcant improvement is achievable is in the dust reddening curve that we assume.
__label__positive At present, our work (like all other 3D dust maps that we are aware of )assumes a single, universal dust extinction curve for the entire Galaxy.
__label__positive However, the shape of the dust extinction spectrum varies signi ﬁcantly throughout the Galaxy (Fitzpa- trick & Massa 1986 ,1988 ,1990 ,2005 ,2007 ,2009 ).A l t h o u g h there are multiple features in the dust extinction spectrum that can vary independently (such as the width and strength of the 2175 A ̊bump, the slope of the wavelength extinction relation in the optical, and the shape of the rise in extinction in the far- ultraviolet ), the dust extinction spectrum is often parameter- ized as a single-parameter family of curves (Cardelli et al.
__label__positive 1989 ), using the ratio of total to selective extinction, RV, deﬁned as: =-AR E B V .3 2 VV () ( ) In the diffuse interstellar medium of the Milky Way, RVis typically taken to be approximately 3.1 (Cardelli et al.
__label__positive However, the value of RVcan vary signi ﬁcantly throughout the interstellar medium.
__label__positive (2017 )combine RV determinations for individual stars (Schla ﬂy et al.
__label__positive 2016 )with the Bayestar2015 3D dust map (Green et al.
__label__positive 2015 )to map the spatial variation of the extinction curve throughout the Milky Way, ﬁnding variations on kiloparsec scales.
__label__positive As most dust maps that use stellar photometry rely primarily on changes instellar colors and are less sensitive to changes in absolutemagnitude, they are essentially maps of dust reddening, rather than extinction.
__label__positive Extinction maps derived from these reddening measurements (e.g., using Equation (32))without knowledge of the spatial dependence of R Vwill have large-scale, spatially dependent systematic errors.
__label__positive Tackling this source of systema-tics is of particular importance to precision cosmologicalmeasurements (Huterer et al.
__label__positive One way to address variation in R Vwithout unduly complicating our model is to treat the dust reddening densityas a pair of numbers at each point in space.
__label__positive (2016 )decompose the reddening vector into a mean component and an orthogonal vector along which most of the variation in the reddening vector occurs.
__label__positive The virtue of this formulation, from the perspective of 3D dust mapping, is that the twocomponents of reddening add linearly, simplifying theirinclusion in our model.
__label__positive (2019 ), who measure distances to a catalog of molecular clouds using stellarphotometry and Gaia parallaxes, take advantage of this linearity to determine the distance and R Vof the dust.
__label__positive More generally, any systematics in reddening maps at high Galactic latitude are of importance to cosmology.
__label__positive (2018 )have identi ﬁed systematic trends in reddening when comparing with the Planck14 , and SFD dust maps, particularly for reddenings of -Egr 0.1 mag () .
__label__positive These systematics could be due to the uncertain zero-point of the dust reddening (e.g., what is the absolute reddening of some reference point on the sky?
__label__positive )and variation in RVacross the high Galactic latitude sky.
__label__positive An additional worry for cosmology iscontamination from large-scale extra-Galactic structure.
__label__positive Forfar-infrared emission-based maps, such as Planck14 , and SFD, this contamination comes from thermal dust emission inexternal galaxies residing at a wide range in redshift (Chiang & Ménard 2019 ).
__label__positive For maps based on stellar colors, such as ours, this contamination comes from quasars and unresolvedgalaxies misconstrued as stars (Chiang & Ménard 2019 ).A t high Galactic latitudes, we estimate the overall level ofcontamination to be ∼3.2% (see Appendix G).
__label__positive More effective rejection of these classes of objects (e.g., by treating them explicitly in our model and by incorporating infrared photo-metry from WISE )will be important to providing reddening maps for use in precision cosmological measurements.
__label__positive There are also additional data sets that can be applied to the dust-mapping problem.
__label__positive Deeper near-infrared photometry, inparticular, will allow us to trace dust to greater extinctions.Dust maps that extend to greater distances, particularly in theGalactic midplane, will allow us to better uncover the overallstructure of the Milky Way.
__label__positive As discussed in Section 4.4, with our present map, extending only a few kiloparsecs, the spiralstructure of the Galaxy is not readily apparent.
__label__positive Incorporation ofdeep infrared photometry —e.g., from the Spitzer GLIMPSE surveys (Churchwell et al.
__label__positive 2009 ), the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey (Lucas et al.
__label__positive 2008 )in the north, the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea survey in the south (Minniti et al.
__label__positive 2010 ), and the recently published unWISE catalog (Schla ﬂy et al.
__label__positive 2019 )— would extend the range of our dust map, particularly in the inner Galaxy.
__label__positive This would allow us to directly see the overallstructure of the spiral arms, rather than drawing curves throughshort segments of them, as we are currently limited to doingwith available 3D dust maps.
__label__positive Finally, the work presented in this paper is limited to the Galaxy north of a decl.
__label__positive The ongoing Dark Energy 20The Astrophysical Journal, 887:93 (27pp ), 2019 December 10 Green et al.
__label__positive 2018, hereafter “DECaPS ”)has already ﬁlled in the Southern Galactic plane in the region b 5 ∣∣ , and is in the process of being extended to b 10 ∣∣ .
__label__positive DECaPS observes in ﬁve PS1-like passbands on the Dark Energy Camera, mounted on the Blanco 4 m telescopein Cerro Tololo, Chile.
__label__positive Incorporation of the resulting photo-metry will allow us to map all 360 ◦of the Galactic midplane.
__label__positive Accessing the Map The dust map presented here can be downloaded at doi:10.7910 /DVN/2EJ9TX .
__label__positive The easiest way to interact with the map, however, is through the Python package dustmaps (Green 2018 ), which provides a uniform interface to a range of maps of dust reddening and extinction, including all of thedust maps discussed in this paper.
__label__positive The map can additionallybe queried interactively at argonaut.skymaps.info .
__label__positive In addition to the dust map, we provide our individual stellar inferences (described in Section 2.1 ).
__label__positive Samples of reddening, distance modulus, absolute rP1magnitude, and metallicity for 799 million stars can be downloaded at doi: 10.7910 /DVN/ AV9GXO .
__label__positive This is an order of magnitude more stellar reddenings than are provided by the Gaia DR2 catalog (Andrae et al.
__label__positive Our technique leverages a greater number of photometric passbands (between four and eight, compared to two independent passbands for Gaia DR2 ), and delivers typical reddening uncertainties that are 30% lower.
__label__positive For stars that are present in Gaia DR2, we provide a cross-match to the corresponding Gaia DR2source _id.
__label__positive Conclusion We have presented a new 3D map of dust reddening, covering three-quarters of the sky out to a distance of a few kiloparsecs.
__label__positive This map is based on stellar distances andreddenings, inferred from Gaia DR2 parallaxes and optical and near-infrared photometry from PS1 and 2MASS.
__label__positive This dust map has a distance resolution four times that of Green et al.
__label__positive Another improvement over our previous method is that we impose a Gaussian-process prior on the logarithm of the dust reddening density, using an approximation that requires far less computational time than a naive approach wouldrequire.
__label__positive This prior encodes our knowledge that the spatial distribution of dust should be smooth on some scale, and has the effect of sharpening our distance determinations to dustclouds, particularly in the nearest kiloparsec, as well as reducing noise in our reddening estimates.
__label__positive We have made both the 3D dust map and the parameter inferences (distances, reddenings, and types )for 799 million stars that underlie the map available at doi: 10.7910 /DVN/ 2EJ9TX and doi: 10.7910 /DVN/AV9GXO , respectively.
__label__positive The dust map is also available through the Python packagedustmaps (Green 2018 ).
__label__positive For the stellar parameter inferences, we provide matches to the Gaia DR2 catalog.
__label__positive At high Galactic latitude, our integrated reddening estimates agree well with those of Planck14 andBayestar17 .W e ﬁnd median residuals between our map and those of the far-infrared radiance-based Planck14 reddening map of D-Eg r() 0.02 mag , out to a reddening of -»Egr 1m a g () .
__label__positive Our new map matches Planck14 better at low column densities, due to the superior signal-to-noise ratio of its reddening determinations.
__label__positive Comparisons with other 3D dust maps show similar overall structures, though the maps have different resolutions andranges of validity.
__label__positive We see the same basic features as Chen19 within a distance of 2 kpc, although we trace the dust distribution with ﬁner distance resolution and to greater distances.
__label__positive Much of this difference is likely attributable to ouruse of deeper optical photometry from PS1, as well as the useof a Gaussian-process prior.
__label__positive In the nearby regime, in a 600 pc3( )box centered on the Sun, we compare our map with that of LE2019 .
__label__positive There are many differences between our methods, with LE2019 employing a Cartesian voxelization of the dust, in contrast to the spherical voxelization that we choose.
__label__positive LE2019 likewise impose a Gaussian-process prior on the logarithm of the dust reddening density, but infers theparameters of the dust reddening correlation function as part ofa hierarchical model.
__label__positive The spatial resolution of the resultingLE2019 map is greater than ours, while the angular resolution of our map is greater.
__label__positive The spiral structure of the Milky Way galaxy is uncertain, with a wide range of models having been developed.
__label__positive Xu et al.(2016 )use HMSFRs with kinematic and distance measure- ments from embedded masers to trace spiral arms.
__label__positive We haveshown that the masers compiled by Xu et al.
__label__positive (2016 )are preferentially distributed in regions of high reddening density in our map.
__label__positive However, in order to use the 3D distribution of dust reddening to assess models of spiral arms, it is necessary toextend our map beyond the current limits of a few kiloparsecs,particularly in the inner Galaxy.
__label__positive One way of achieving this willbe the incorporation of deeper near-infrared photometry,allowing us to see stars through far greater dust columndensities.

__label__positive Appendix A Grid Evaluation of Stellar Posterior Densities In contrast to our approach in Green et al.
__label__positive (2014,2015, 2018 ), here we brute-force evaluate the single-star posterior probability densities on a regular grid, rather than approximat-ing them using a kernel density estimate on MCMC samples.
__label__positive This brute-force approach is feasible —and indeed extremely fast—with a few approximations.
__label__positive For any given stellar type, the observed magnitudes depend only linearly on the reddeningand distance modulus.
__label__positive As the uncertainties on our observedmagnitudes are Gaussian, the likelihood of any parameters thatthe magnitudes depend on linearly is also Gaussian.
__label__positive In otherwords, mQpm E ,, 3 3 (ˆ∣) ( ) is Gaussian in μandEforﬁxedΘ.
__label__positive Moreover, the covariance of this Gaussian depends only on the observational uncertaintiesand the reddening curve.
__label__positive Our scheme for calculating the stellar posteriors is thus as follows: 1.
__label__positive For each point in a uniform grid in Θ, calculate the μand Ethat maximize the likelihood mQpm E ,, (ˆ∣) .
__label__positive Add a Gaussian centered on each μ*andE*, weighted byvm mQQpm E p E,, , , , ** ** (ˆˆ∣ )( ) .
__label__positive The second step makes the approximation that, over the Gaussian centered on a given mE,**( ), the likelihood in parallax and the prior on μare constant.
__label__positive In our testing, this approximation typically only had a small effect.
__label__positive Using this method, we evaluate mvpE m,,(∣ ˆˆ)over a grid in distance modulus and reddening, with a bin scale of 0.125 mag in distance modulus and 0.01 mag in reddening.This information is carried over into the line-of-sight inference.However, in order to save disk space, we ultimately storesamples from the posterior, discarding the grid-evaluatedposterior density after we have completed the line-of-sightinference.
__label__positive This scheme is fast: on a single core, with a library of ∼41,000 stellar templates, we are typically able to evaluate the gridded posterior densities of ∼50 stars per second.Appendix B Round-robin Sampling of Neighboring Pixels To update each neighboring sightline, we choose a new sample from the previous iteration, conditioned on the reddening densities in the other pixels in the patch.
__label__positive This is essentially an importance-sampling step, and we must choosethe new sample according to the ratio of the new posteriordensity to the posterior density of the sample in the previous iteration.
__label__positive During each iteration, we must therefore store the posterior density for each sample of the central pixel, to be usedwhen resampling pixels in the following iterations.
__label__positive For a given sightline i, òaa a a = pm m p m m d ,, , 3 4ii i iii i i(∣ ˆˆ )( ∣ ˆˆ )( ) ⧹⧹ ⧹ ⧹ òaa a a=pm m p m m d ,, , 3 5ii ii ii i i(∣ ˆˆ )( ∣ ˆˆ )( ) ⧹⧹ ⧹ ⧹ ⧹ òaa a a a =pm p p m m d1,3 6 ii i i ii i i(ˆ∣) (∣ ) ( ∣ ˆˆ )( ) ⧹⧹ ⧹ ⧹ aa a =á ñ a ºº pm p1,3 7 ii i i m m , iii i i(ˆ∣) ( ∣ ) ( ) ⧹∣ ˆˆ⧹⧹     whereis a normalizing constant dependent only on the data —and can therefore be ignored.
__label__positive For simplicity, mˆhere denotes both photometry and parallaxes.
__label__positive The second term, i, is the likelihood of αi, which does not change from iteration to iteration.
__label__positive The third term, i, is the “effective prior ”onαi generated by the neighboring sightlines, averaged over the range of values that the reddening in those sightlines can take.
__label__positive In the ﬁrst iteration, the calculation of this “effective prior, ”i,i s trivial.
__label__positive As the pixels are independent, it is simply equal to the prior onαi.
__label__positive However, in subsequent iterations, we must estimate ifor each sample we store of αi, by calculating the average of aapii(∣ ) ⧹over samples of ai⧹drawn from the chain.
__label__positive This is done as a post-processing step after we are done sampling the patch of sky.
__label__positive The computational complexity of this step is n2()in the number of samples stored, because for each of the nsamples of αi we store, we have to average over aapii(∣ ) ⧹fornsamples of ai⧹.
__label__positive In order to select a new sample for one of the neighboring pixels j, we therefore select one of the stored samples from the previous iteration, with the probability of selecting sample k being proportional to aa a a a==  wpm p p,3 8jkjjk jk j jk jkjk j jk(ˆ∣) (∣ ) (∣ )()⧹⧹ wherejkandjkare the stored likelihood and effective prior, respectively, for sample kof sightline jfrom the previous iteration.
__label__positive If the stored samples for the neighboring pixels are a decent approximation to the new correlated posterior on neighboring sightlines, then this sampling procedure will work well.
__label__positive Over succeeding iterations, we slowly change the covariance kernelfrom completely diagonal (i.e., independent sightlines )to the target kernel.
__label__positive If we change the covariance kernel too drastically from one iteration to the next, then the stored samples will be apoor representation of the posterior density, and will not be able to represent the state of the neighboring sightlines in the current iteration.
__label__positive As in importance sampling, this wouldmanifest itself as the entropy of the weight distribution =¼wk n 1, 2, ,jk{∣} approaching zero.
__label__positive 22The Astrophysical Journal, 887:93 (27pp ), 2019 December 10 Green et al.
__label__positive Appendix C Improving Markov Chain Mixing with the “Deformation Ladder ” The sampling procedure for a patch of sky described above can suffer from poor Markov chain mixing.
__label__positive Our distance bins aresigniﬁcantly longer in the radial than in the angular direction (by a typical factor of ∼30), leading to the trans verse correlations between neighboring voxels at the same distance being muchgreater than correlations between pixels at different distances.
__label__positive Onepossible failure mode of our sampling procedure may occur whenthere is a dust cloud at a particular distance, spanning severalneighboring sightlines.
__label__positive The cor related prior will tend to favor solutions in which the dust is placed at the same distance in all thesightlines.
__label__positive The prior imposes a penalty if the dust cloud is moved forward or backward in distance in just one sightline.
__label__positive With the round-robin sampling procedure we employ for each patch of sky,t h i sm e a n st h a ti ti sd i f ﬁcult for the cloud to transition from one distance to another.
__label__positive The sampler becomes locked in a state with thecloud at one distance, and has to traverse a high potential barrier inorder to reach solutions with the cloud at different distances.
__label__positive In order to deal with this problem, we employ a method that is conceptually similar to parallel tempering.
__label__positive Parallel tempering worksby creating a ladder of samplers, with the bottom rung samplingfrom the target distribution and successively higher rungs samplingfrom progressively ﬂattened versions of the distribution (using a sampling temperature parameter to control the ﬂattening of the distribution ).
__label__positive The higher-temperature samplers are able to explore a larger region of parameter space, allowing the sampler to transition between different modes, while swaps between the states of different rungs on the ladder allow the lower-temperature samplersto bene ﬁt from the increased exploration at higher temperatures.
__label__positive In our problem, parallel tempering performs badly beyond the initial iteration (without coupling between nearby sightlines ),a s the samples we store from previous iterations are a poorrepresentation of the higher-temp erature distributions.
__label__positive We build a ladder of samplers, but employ a different parameterization to modify the target distribution.
__label__positive Our approach is to modify theinverse covariance matrix, in order to introduce correlationsbetween voxels in neighboring distance bins.
__label__positive Instead of atemperature, we introduce a distance-mixing parameter, ò,w h i c h allows us to smoothly interpolat e between the approximately isotropic target distribution and distributions in which correlations in the radial direction are stronger than in the transverse direction.
__label__positive The form of the deformation of the inverse covariance matrix is sketched out in Figure 19.
__label__positive The entries linking neighboring distance bins of different angular pixels increase with the distance-mixing parameter, ò, according to the formula given in Figure 19.
__label__positive The entries linking neighboring distance bins of the same angular pixel (i.e., sightline )areﬁxed to zero.
__label__positive This ensures that when we sample a single sightline, keeping the neighbors ﬁxed, the different distance bins are independent, and thus speeds up the sampling procedure signi ﬁcantly.
__label__positive A distance-mixing parameter of ò=0 indicates no change to the inverse covariance matrix.
__label__positive As òincreases, the penalty for moving a dust cloud forward or backward in a single distancebin typically decreases.
__label__positive Just as in parallel tempering, we can treat the ladder of samplers as if they are sampling a single, augmented parameterspace.
__label__positive If the original parameter space is denoted by θ , then the augmented parameter space is the Cartesian product ofθ 0×θ1×θ2×L×θN, with θicorresponding to distance- mixing parameter òiandNbeing the number of rungs in theladder.
__label__positive The probability density that we assign to the augmented space is given by qqq q qqq q¼ =p ppp p,,,, ,3 9N NN012 0 0 11 2 2() ()( )( ) () ()  where qpii()uses the inverse covariance matrix deformed with parameter òi.
__label__positive Because the probability density of the augmented space is factorizable in this manner, we can sample in eachsubspace independently.
__label__positive However, we introduce swap stepsbetween neighboring rungs of the ladder, in which we propose to exchange the values of θ iandθi+1.
__label__positive The Metropolis –Hastings acceptance probability for this step is qq qq++ ++pp ppmin , 1 .
__label__positive 40iiii iiii1 1 1 1() ( ) () ( )()⎡ ⎣⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ For parallel tempering, this acceptance probability simpli ﬁes down to an elegant form, but in the more general case of aladder of modi ﬁed probability densities, the above acceptance ratio does not necessarily simplify.
__label__positive Notice that the cross-distance co upling introduced in the higher rungs of the “deformation ladder ”only affects the Gaussian process prior that couples nearby s ightlines.
__label__positive In the initial iteration, however, we treat each sigh tline independently, so the “deforma- tion ladder ”would have no effect.
__label__positive We therefore use standard parallel tempering in the initial iteration, in order to improve convergence of our MCMC sample r.
__label__positive In correlated iterations, we use a ladder with three rungs, with th e distance-mixing parameter increasing linearly from =- » exp 2 0.14() in the bottom rung to =-» exp 1 4 0.78() in the top rung.
__label__positive Note that the distance-mixing parameter is nonzero in the bottom rung, meaningthat our target posterior density is slightly modi ﬁed and contains small cross-distance correlations.
__label__positive The entries corresponding to different angular pixels (p0,p1, etc.
__label__positive In the original inverse covariance matrix, the cross- distance entries are zero.
__label__positive As we deform the inverse covariance matrix, we modify the entries linking different angular pixels in neighboring distance bins.
__label__positive We do not alter entries linking the same angular pixel in neighboring distance bins.
__label__positive Afterward, the entire matrix is multiplied by the scalar +- 121() .
__label__positive The variable òcontrols the amount of deformation, with ò=0 leaving the matrix unaltered.

__label__positive Appendix D Assessing Convergence of the Line-of-sight Reddening Sampler We test for convergence of our line-of-sight sampling by measuring the autocorrelation time of certain functions of the line-of-sight reddening density parameters, α.
__label__positive There are many different functions that one could choose to try to assess chainmixing, but we choose three: the prior, the likelihood, and the amplitude of the ﬁrst principal component of αin the central pixel.
__label__positive This third function measures how quickly the samplerexplores the direction in parameter space that accounts for mostof the variance in the Markov chain.
__label__positive Typically, this direction in parameter space corresponds to changing the distance to the dominant cloud along the line of sight.
__label__positive We require that thenumber of samples in the Markov chain be at least 20 times the autocorrelation time of each of these three functions.
__label__positive Figure 20 illustrates these convergence criteria for both a converged and anonconverged case.
__label__positive For pixels that fail this convergence criterion, we sample again with more robust settings (i.e., more steps and additional rungs in the deformation ladder ).
__label__positive If a pixel fails to converge within three attempts, we ﬂag the pixel and continue.
__label__positive Fewer than 0.25% of pixels fail this convergence test in any of theiterations.
__label__positive Appendix E Implementation Details In order to impose the Gaussian process prior, we choose the 32 nearest neighbors of each sightline.
__label__positive Each sightline in ourmap is thus sampled from a slightly different model, in which it is correlated with a patch of sky surrounding it.
__label__positive In each iteration, we sample the patch as described above, and then discard the information from the neighboring sightlines in thepatch, retaining only the Markov chain samples from thecentral sightline.
__label__positive After an initial pass over the sky, in which wesample the reddening along each sightline independently, weconduct four iterations with a correlated prior, increasing the correlation length with each iteration (see Table 5).
__label__positive As described above, as we sample the reddening ﬁeld in a patch of sky, we alternate between updating the central sightline and updating the neighbors.
__label__positive ”In each round, we make 24000 Metropolis – Hastings proposals in the central sightline (equivalent to 20 proposals per distance bin )andﬁve Gibbs steps in each of the neighboring sightlines.
__label__positive In the initial, uncorrelated iteration, wesample for 2500 rounds, discarding the ﬁrst 500 as burn-in.
__label__positive In subsequent, correlated iterations, we sample for 2250 rounds, discarding the ﬁrst 450 as burn-in.
__label__positive We save only the results from the central sightline, storing 100 samples.Figure 20.
__label__positive An example of our convergence diagnostic for an MCMC run with good convergence (top panels ), and for one with poor convergence (bottom panels ).
__label__positive The left panels show three functions of the sampled parameters (the logarithms of the prior and likelihood, and the amplitude of the ﬁrst principal component )as a function of sampling step.
__label__positive The right panels show the autocorrelation of these three functions.
__label__positive Nonconvergence can be diagnosed from the long autocor relation time in the bottom right panel.

__label__positive The typical runtime per sightline is a function both of the number of stars in the sightline as well as the number ofneighboring sightlines.
__label__positive The runtime contains a term that is linear in the number of stars, due to the need to calculate one line integral per star in the line-of-sight reddening posterior(Equation (14)).
__label__positive For reasons that may have to do with the need to store gridded stellar posterior densities in memory (speciﬁcally, with the number that can be stored in cache ), there is also a small quadratic dependence of runtime on thenumber of stars.
__label__positive The runtime has a term that scales quadratically with the number of sightlines, due to the need to sample each neighboring sightline and the fact that the prioron each sightline depends on all of the neighbors.
__label__positive With 32 neighbors, running on a single core of an Intel Xeon ES- 2683v4 with a clock speed of 2.1 GHz and a cache size of 40MB, we achieve a typical runtime of »+ + ts nn150 0.5 510041 run2 () ⎜⎟⎛ ⎝⎞ ⎠ per sightline, where nåis the number of stars in the sightline.
__label__positive In the initial iteration, in which no neighboring pixels must besampled, the typical runtime has the same dependence on thenumber of stars, but lacks the constant term.
__label__positive This runtime isdominated by the line-of-sight sampler, as the time required forthe grid evaluation of the individual stellar posterior densities isnegligible in comparison.
__label__positive The median number of stars per sightline is ∼130, yielding a typical runtime of ~75 s sightlin e for the initial, uncorrelated iteration, and ~225 s sightline for the correlated iterations.
__label__positive Running on a mix of Intel and AMD cores on Harvard ’s Odyssey cluster, the initial, uncorrelated iteration consumed approximately 700 million CPU seconds, while each succes-sive iteration consumed approximately 1.5 billion CPU seconds, for a total runtime of ∼7 billion CPU seconds to generate the full map.
__label__positive Appendix F Fitting a Line to Data Here, we describe our method of ﬁtting a linear relation between two quantities with measurement uncertainties.
__label__positive InSection 4.5, we use this model to determine the relation between A V, as measured by StarHorse and either our inferred -Egr() or the inferred -EBP RP() from Andrae2018 .
__label__positive The model we describe here is very similar to that described by Hogg et al.
__label__positive (2010 ), with the addition of a systematic error ﬂoor in the measured values of y.
__label__positive Our observed data consists of Nmeasured values of xˆandyˆ, with reported Gaussian uncertainties σxandσy.
__label__positive We assume that each data point is either “good, ”in which case the true values ofxandy(without measurement error )follow a linear relation, =+ym xb ,4 2 () or an “outlier, ”in which case the true values of xandyare independently distributed Gaussian random variates, withmeans mxb,andmyb,, and standard deviations Sxb,and Sy,b.
__label__positive The prior probability of any given data point being an outlier is Pb.
__label__positive We additionally assume that the reported values of σyare systematically underestimated, and that the true uncertainty inthe measured value of yis given by ss s=+ .4 3yy,true22 02() In order to determine the calculate the likelihood of a single data point, sss mmº ´xy pxy mbP S S,, , , , ,, , , , , , 4 4xy bxbxbybyb0 , , , ,(ˆˆ)( ˆˆ∣ )( ) it is necessary to specify a prior on the true value of x.W e impose a ﬂat prior, which yields a closed-form solution for the likelihood, as long as the width of the prior is large comparedto sxand contains the measured value, xˆ.
__label__positive This unfortunately introduces one more arbitrary parameter into the problem, Δx, the width of the ﬂat prior in x.
__label__positive We choose Δxto be approximately the same as the range of observed xˆ, and the recovered parameters do not depend sensitively on the choice ofΔx.

__label__positive In Section 4.5, we treat the StarHorse estimates of A Vasx, and our -Egr() estimates or Andrae2018 ʼs-EBP RP() estimates as y.
__label__positive The priors on our model parameters are given in Table 6.
__label__positive We use the emcee Python package (Foreman-Mackey et al.
__label__positive 2013 )to sample from our model, using 90 walkers, 2500 steps per walker for burn-in, and subsequently 5000 steps per walker.
__label__positive The resulting median inferred values of m,b, and σ0are given in Section 4.5.
__label__positive Appendix G Estimating Level of Galaxy and Quasar Contamination Our 3D dust mapping technique relies on distance and reddening inferences of stars.
__label__positive However, quasars and galaxies leak into our source catalog, particularly at faint magnitudes, where morphological compactness is less effective at separat-ing stars and galaxies, and both quasars and galaxies are more abundant.
__label__positive Due to thermal dust emission, galaxies and quasars are typically bright in near- and mid-infrared wavelengths, andhave redder -Wz 1P 1 colors.
__label__positive Here, we construct a classi ﬁer that leverages this feature to separate stars from galaxies andTable 6 Priors on Linear Model Parameter Prior Parameter Prior m U16 , 32( ) b -U 0.25, 0.25() Pb U0, 1( ) sln 0 -U 8, 0( ) μx,b U0, 10( ) Sx,b U0.1, 10( ) μy,b U0, 3( ) Sy,b U0.1, 3() 25The Astrophysical Journal, 887:93 (27pp ), 2019 December 10 Green et al.
__label__positive Our training data set consists of a matched catalog of sources with SDSS DR14 spectra, PS1 rizP1photometry, and unWISE W1photometry.
__label__positive We require the SDSS spectra to pass the following quality cuts: 1.
__label__positive We require less than 0.2 mag uncertainties in rizP1andW1, and reduced χ2of less than 2 for W1.
__label__positive Finally, we restrict our training data set to Galactic latitudes of b>30°andSFD reddenings of -<EBV 0.1 mag () .
__label__positive Using this labeled data set, we train a Support Vector Machine (SVM )withscikit- learn (Pedregosa et al.
__label__positive 2011 )to classify sources as either stars or galaxies /quasars, based on their rP1−iP1and-zW P1 1 colors.
__label__positive We obtain a linear decision boundary in color –color space (see the top panel of Figure 21).
__label__positive However, many sources are detected in rizP1but not in W1.
__label__positive Because galaxies and quasars are typically redder than stars in -zW P1 1 , nondetection in W1combined with detection in zP1can indicate with high con ﬁdence that a source is a star.
__label__positive If unWISE W1has a limiting magnitude of W1,lim, and galaxies and quasars are always redder than -zWP1 1 blue( ), then galaxies or quasars withzP1magnitude of <+ -zW zW 46 P1 1,lim P1 1 blue () ( ) will be observed in W1.
__label__positive We thus only classify stars that both satisfy this cut and are also observed in rP1andiP1.
__label__positive Sources that are observed in W1are classi ﬁed using our SVM, while sources that are unobserved in W1are assumed to be stars.
__label__positive We apply this classi ﬁcation to high Galactic latitude (b>85°) sources in our input catalog that are observed in rizP1(and pass theχ2/passband cut described in 2.1 ).
__label__positive Based on our training data set, we conservatively estimate -» -zW 0.5 mag P1 1 blue( ) .
__label__positive Thus, we only attempt to classify sources with zP1<20.79 mag, for which nondetection in W1indicates that a source is a star.
__label__positive Weﬁnd that, for b>85°, 3.2% of sources entering into our line-of-sight reddening inference are galaxies or quasars, with rising contamination toward fainter magnitudes (see the bottom panel of Figure 21).

__label__positive Be stars are rapidly rotating B main sequence stars, which show line emission due to an outﬂowing disc.
__label__positive By studying the evolution of rotating single star models, we can assess their contribution to the observed Be star populations.
__label__positive We identify the main e ects which are responsible for single stars to approach critical rotation as functions of initial mass and metallicity, and predict the properties of populations of rotating single stars.
__label__positive We perform population synthesis with single star models of initial masses ranging between 3 and 30 M , initial equatorial rotation velocities between 0 and 600 km s 1at compositions representing the Milky Way, Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.
__label__positive These models include e cient core-envelope coupling mediated by internal magnetic ﬁelds and correspond to the maximum e ciency of Be star production.
__label__positive We predict Be star fractions and the positions of fast rotating stars in the colour-magnitude diagram.
__label__positive We identify stellar wind mass-loss and the convective core mass fraction as the key parameters which determine the time dependance of the stellar rotation rates.
__label__positive Using empirical distributions of initial rotational velocities, our single star models can repro- duce the trends observed in Be star fractions with mass and metallicity.
__label__positive However, they fail to produce a signiﬁcant number of stars rotating very close to critical.
__label__positive We also ﬁnd that rapidly rotating Be stars in the Magellanic Clouds should have signiﬁcant surface nitrogen enrichments, which may be in conﬂict with abundance determinations of Be stars.
__label__positive Single star evolution may explain the high number of Be stars if 70 to 80% of critical rotation would be su cient to produce the Be phenomenon.
__label__positive However even in this case, the unexplained presence of many Be stars far below the cluster turn-o  indicates the importance of the binary channel for Be star production.
__label__positive stars: massive – stars: Be – stars: rotation – stars: evolution 1.
__label__positive Introduction Ever since their discovery over 150 years ago (Secchi 1866), Be stars have o ered a promising, although misted window into massive star evolution and structure.
__label__positive It was proposed by Struve (1931) that Be stars are fast rotators, whose emission lines origi- nate from a circumstellar decretion disc, a picture which is main- tained until today (Rivinius et al.
__label__positive Yet, it is still not clear how fast a B-type star must rotate in order to become a Be star.
__label__positive For a decretion disc to form, the equatorial rotation velocity 3rotis expected to be a signiﬁcant fraction of the critical rotation velocity, vcrit, deﬁned as the rotation velocity at which material at the equator becomes unbound from the star.
__label__positive Observational ev- idence suggests that the threshold rotation rate for the Be phe- nomenon is mass dependant, and could be as low as 3rot=3crit= 0.6 for stars more massive than 8.6 M and as high as 3rot=3crit= 0.96 for stars with M<4 M(Huang et al.
__label__positive (2016) ﬁnd that the Be phenomenon is character- ized by a wide range of true velocity ratios (0.3 <3rot=3crit< 0.95) and that the probability that Be stars are critical rotators is small.
__label__positive In this case one must look for an additional mechanism to feed the Be disc.
__label__positive Pulsations seem promising as they can serve to kick matter from the surface of a star, however it is found that not all Be stars pulsate (Baade et al.
__label__positive 2002) and that among those that do there is a wide range of pulation frequencies and types (Rivinius et al.
__label__positive Another possibility is that the disc is fed through outbursts of magnetically active starspots, simi-lar to coronal mass ejections as seen in the Sun, as suggested by Balona & Ozuyar (2019) based on recent TESS results.
__label__positive (2004) have argued that all Be stars in fact rotate very close ( 3rot=3crit>0:95) to the criti- cal velocity, with those which have low measured rotation rates being strongly a ected by gravity darkening.
__label__positive Following the V on Zeipel law (von Zeipel 1924), gravity darkening in a fast rotat- ing star makes the stellar pole, which has a low rotational veloc- ity, more luminous than the equator which has a high rotational velocity, resulting in the star appearing as though it is rotating slower than in reality.
__label__positive A further question surrounding Be stars is why the phe- nomenon seems to be restricted mostly to B-type stars and why Be stars are more common in certain spectral classes than oth- ers.
__label__positive Observations in the Milky Way show that the fraction of Be stars in a certain spectral class varies across spectral type with the most Be-stars found at B1-B2 classiﬁcation, where the Be fraction is 34% while in comparison the Be fraction for B9 stars is 8% and the total fraction of Be stars to B stars was measured to be 17% (Zorec & Briot 1997).
__label__positive Furthermore, Oe stars seem to be rather rare, with less than 20 having been detected in the Milky Way (Li et al.
__label__positive It is not clear whether this is caused by pro- cesses within O stars themselves, the mechanisms responsible for forming a disc around a fast rotating star, or the conditions under which very massive stars form.
__label__positive The existence of around 150 (Raguzova & Popov 2005) de- tected binary systems consisting of a Be star and a compact ob- ject (so called Be /X-ray binaries) demonstrates that binary inter- Article number, page 1 of 14arXiv:1912.05290v1  [astro-ph.SR]  11 Dec 2019
__label__positive Be_paper actions can spin up a star signiﬁcantly (Kriz & Harmanec 1975; Pols et al.
__label__positive In order to build a full model of the Be phenomenon, binary evolution must be as well understood as the channels for forming single Be stars.
__label__positive van Bever & Vanbeveren (1997) used binary star evolution calculations to predict that at most 20% of the Be star popula- tion results from binary interactions.
__label__positive Despite this, observations of surface nitrogen abundances in Magellanic Cloud Be stars are in disagreement with fast rotating single star models (Dunstall et al.
__label__positive Thus questions such as, which is the dominant Be star formation channel and what are the di erences between the single and binary Be population remain open.
__label__positive Considerable e orts have been made to predict the relative fractions of Be stars through single star modelling, most notably by Ekström et al.
__label__positive These models include coupling be- tween core and envelope by hydrodynamic viscosities through the shear instability.
__label__positive However, a stronger coupling may be pro- duced by internal magnetic ﬁelds known as the Tayler-Spruit dy- namo (Spruit 2002) which produces very e cient angular mo- mentum transport throughout the star so that near solid-body rotation occurs.
__label__positive The models analysed here include such e ects, and therefore employ the maximum e ciency of spinning up the surface layers due to the core contraction during hydrogen burn- ing, which is a key factor to produce single Be stars.
__label__positive At present the Tayler-Spruit dynamo is used to explain relatively slow rota- tion rates in white dwarfs (Suijs et al.
__label__positive In Section 2 the models are introduced and our approaches are outlined.
__label__positive In Section 3, models from the grid are analysed un- der conditions of fast and slow rotation for MW and SMC metal- licities, the factors governing the approach to the critical velocity are investigated and the expected surface nitrogen abundances of Be stars is investigated.
__label__positive In Section 4, population synthesis is per- formed to calculate the expected fractions of single Be stars in clusters of di ering ages and metallicities and predict the posi- tions of fast rotating stars in the colour-magnitude diagram.
__label__positive Stellar Models We analyse the single star evolutionary models of Brott et al.
__label__positive (2011) to predict the properties of rotating single stars through- out their main-sequence evolution.
__label__positive We consider masses from 3 Mto 30 Mat various initial rotation velocities ranging from zero to approximately 600 km s 1.
__label__positive Because the model grid is spaced in initial rotational velocities, but the initial critical ro- tation velocity increases with mass, our grid does not contain models with initial values of 3rot=3critgreater than around 0.7 for initial masses greater than 25 M .
__label__positive Three initial chemical compositions represent metallicities of the Milky Way (MW), Large Magellanic Could (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).
__label__positive The models include internal transport of angular momentum via the Taylor-Spruit dynamo (Spruit 2002) which has the e ect of enforcing near solid-body rotation throughout most of the main-sequence evolution.
__label__positive The adopted mass-loss scheme is given by Vink et al.
__label__positive An en- hancement of the mass loss due to rotation is used as outlined in Yoon & Langer (2005), whereby the mass loss rates are in- creased by a factor depending on the ratio of the rotation velocity to the critical velocity like˙M( )=˙M(0) 1 1 3rot 3crit!0:43 (1) where 3crit=r GM R(1  ) ;  =L 4cGM: (2) For a detailed description of the models see Brott et al.
__label__positive Population Synthesis To predict properties of populations of rotating stars we use pop- ulation synthesis to model open star clusters (i.e.
__label__positive collections of coeval stars without any continuous star formation) at various ages.
__label__positive For a cluster age t, we select pairs of random values from a Salpeter initial mass distribution (with exponent 2.35) and a distribution of initial critical velocity fraction, Miand 3rot=3criti.
__label__positive Then we ﬁnd the masses, M1;M2on the model grid that are straddling the chosen mass value, such that M1<Mi<M2.
__label__positive For M1andM2we interpolate the hydrogen burning lifetimes, tMS as a function of initial critical velocity fraction to obtain the hy- drogen burning lifetimes at the chosen value, 3rot=3criti.
__label__positive Next the hydrogen burning lifetime, tMS;i, of a model with mass Miand initial rotation 3rot=3critiis found by interpolating between the hydrogen burning lifetimes of M1andM2.
__label__positive The fractional life- time is then given by t=tMS;i.
__label__positive If the fractional lifetime is greater than 1, the star will not be hydrogen burning anymore so the process is abandoned and new samples are drawn.
__label__positive We then se- lect models with masses M1andM2at fractional hydrogen burn- ing times t=tMS;i.
__label__positive An interpolation of the quantity of interest, Q across initial critical velocity fraction gives the values of Qfor masses M1;M2with initial rotation 3rot=3critiand fractional hy- drogen burning time t=tMS;i.
__label__positive One ﬁnal interpolation between M1 andM2gives the predicted quantity of the selected mass Miat the given cluster age.
__label__positive The quantities of interest are luminosity, critical velocity fraction at the current time and e ective temper- ature.
__label__positive The initial rotational velocity distribution used was taken from VLT-FLAMES observations of early B stars in the 30 Do- radus region of the LMC (Dufton et al.
__label__positive The deconvolved distribution of equatorial rotational ve- locities was converted to a distribution in critical velocity frac- tion by applying a mapping between the two as determined from the 15 MLMC models at ZAMS and then normalizing such that the integral over the whole probability density function equals unity.
__label__positive It is noted that for the heaviest masses on the grid, the dis- tribution extends beyond its limits.
__label__positive When such a massive, very fast rotating star is chosen from the distributions, instead the fastest rotator in the grid is used.
__label__positive Observations in 30 Doradus show that no O stars are observed to rotate with deconvolved equatorial velocities much greater than 500 km s 1(Ramírez- Agudelo et al.
__label__positive For a 25 M star to rotate at a critical velocity fraction of 0.7, it would require an equatorial rotation velocity of the order 700 kms 1.
__label__positive It is thus safe to assume that O stars do not enter the ZAMS with initial critical velocity fractions much greater than 0.65, or that if they do, they spin down very quickly.
__label__positive We note that adopting the observed distribution of rotational velocities of Dufton et al.

__label__positive The up- per scale shows how the critical velocity fraction values, 3rot=3critmatch to the equatorial velocities, 3rot.
__label__positive inconsistency, since the the sample of Dufton et al.
__label__positive 3.1 below), the rotational velocities of the considered single stars are expected to change very little during their main sequence evolution.
__label__positive If binary evolution a ects this distribution de Mink et al.
__label__positive (2013), then we would overesti- mate the number of stars which are born rotating very rapidly.
__label__positive In this case, the predicted number of Be stars from our models may be considered as upper limits.
__label__positive To compare the models with observations of the SMC open cluster NCG 330 (Milone et al.
__label__positive 2018) in the colour-magnitude diagram, the bolometric luminosities and e ective temperature are converted to absolute magnitudes in the Hubble Space Tele- scope Wide-Field Camera 3 ﬁlters F814W and F336W by inter- polating tables based on synthetic stellar spectra (Girardi et al.
__label__positive The values of distance modulus and reddening adopted are (m M)=18:92 and E(B V)=0:06 respectively.
__label__positive The absorption coe cients used are AF814W=2:04E(B V) and AF336W=5:16E(B V) (Milone et al.
__label__positive The e ects of gravity darkening are included as described by Espinosa Lara & Rieutord (2011), whereby the e ective temperature and lumi- nosity of a star are multiplied by parameters that depend on the inclination angle and fraction of angular critical velocity.
__label__positive Then using these corrected e ective temperature and luminosity val- ues, we calculate the absolute magnitudes as described above.
__label__positive The inclination angles, i, in our synthetic population are chosen such that cos( i) is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, mean- ing that it is more likely to observe any given star equator-on than pole-on.
__label__positive Such a distribution describes a random orientation of the rotation axis.
__label__positive Spin Evolution During the evolution of a slowly rotating star during core hydro- gen burning, a strong chemical gradient develops between the convective core and the radiative envelope.
__label__positive The core density in- creases, and as a reaction the envelope must expand in order tomaintain hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium.
__label__positive 2 shows that as the stellar radius increases, the critical velocity decreases, thus during main-sequence evolution, the critical velocity will fall.
__label__positive In the absence of internal angular momentum transport, as core density increases, the local conservation of angular momen- tum will demand that the angular velocity of the core increases.
__label__positive Likewise as the envelope expands, the angular velocity of the envelope will decrease.
__label__positive This results in an angular velocity gradi- ent developing between the convective core and radiative enve- lope.
__label__positive However when the core and envelope are coupled via angu- lar momentum transport, angular momentum is transported from the core to the envelope, decreasing the angular velocity gradi- ent throughout the star.
__label__positive The physical processes responsible for the angular momentum transport in the models studied here are magnetic torques arising from the Tayler-Spruit dynamo (Spruit 2002), which leads to near solid body rotation.
__label__positive While the en- velope is expanding and the star is rotating as a solid body, the critical rotation velocity will decrease while the equatorial rota- tion velocity drops only slowly or even increases (see Section 3.3).
__label__positive 2 gives examples of the evolution of critical velocity, equatorial velocity and fraction of critical velocity during main- sequence evolution for MW and SMC models of initial masses 5,15 and 25 M .
__label__positive All models in the plot have an initial critical ve- locity fraction of approximately 0.6.
__label__positive Although the less massive models have slower equatorial velocities, they also have lower critical velocities (because of a relatively weak dependance on radius with mass), making the critical velocity fraction nearly the same for all models in the plot.
__label__positive It is seen that for the 5 M  models the equatorial rotation velocity remains nearly constant, while the critical velocity decreases.
__label__positive For the 15 M models, the equatorial rotation velocity increases due to the e ects of angular momentum transport.
__label__positive As a result, the critical velocity fraction is generally increasing during hydrogen burning such that the stars are evolving closer to critical rotation, unless angular momentum is drained at a high rate due to mass loss (see Section 3.2).
__label__positive The Effect of Mass-loss The dominating e ect of mass-loss through stellar winds is to remove angular momentum, not mass.
__label__positive This is so because even in the absence of magnetic ﬁelds, the rate of angular momen- tum loss relative to the total angular momentum is about 10 times larger than the rate of mass loss relative to the stellar mass (Langer 1998).
__label__positive Thus a star’s mass-loss may strongly a ect the spin evolution.
__label__positive 2 show that models at MW metallicity experience a turn-over in the evolution of their critical velocity fraction.
__label__positive This is because in the late stages of hydrogen burn- ing, the star’s mass-loss rate increases signiﬁcantly which has the eect of removing angular momentum from the surface at a rate which cannot be compensated by internal angular momen- tum transport mechanisms, meaning that solid body rotation is no longer a good approximation and the equatorial velocity de- creases.
__label__positive This period of strong mass-loss is caused by the iron opacity bistability in which partial recombination of Fe ions at eective temperatures of around 22kK causes a sharp increase in opacity and hence mass-loss (Lamers et al.
__label__positive This be- haviour is strongly dependant on metallicity and so weaker in the SMC or LMC models.
__label__positive 2, it can be seen that despite both MW and SMC models starting with approximately equal critical velocity fractions, the SMC model achieves a much larger critical velocity fraction at the end of the main-sequence.

__label__positive The initial critical velocity fraction values are all approximately 0.6.
__label__positive The X-axis indicates the fractional main sequence lifetime, t=tMS.
__label__positive els illustrates the e ect of mass-loss on the approach to the crit- ical velocity.
__label__positive 3 shows the ratio of angular momentum at the end of hydrogen burning to the initial angular momentum for models of varying mass and initial critical velocity fraction for MW and SMC models.
__label__positive It is clear that almost every SMC model loses much less angular momentum than the corresponding model at MW metallicity.
__label__positive The exceptions are fast rotating massive SMC models which undergo quasi-chemically homogeneous evolu- tion, and during so become very luminous which leads to in- creased mass loss rates.
__label__positive For SMC models one may judge that mass-loss becomes irrelevant to the angular-momentum budget below masses of around 10 M , where most models (except very fast initial rotators, say with 3rot=3crit>0.7) retain more than 90% of their angular momentum.
__label__positive For MW models we see that only slowly rotating models less massive than 5 M retain more than 90% of their angular momentum.
__label__positive As expected, the e ect of mass-loss is strongly metallicity dependant.
__label__positive It is also seen that below 15:::20 M, angular momentum loss becoming less de- pendant on mass.
__label__positive 3 shows that for any given mass the fraction of angular momentum lost is a strong function of the initial rotation.
__label__positive For ex- ample a 5 Mmodel at MW metallicity can lose between 2 and 30 % of its initial angular momentum.
__label__positive One contributing factor is the lifetime e ect, whereby under the e ects of rotation, rota- tional mixing causes hydrogen to be mixed into the centre of the star and so hydrogen burning can continue for a longer time.
__label__positive For all of our models, the hydrogen burning lifetime enhancement between the non-rotating model and that with an initial rotation velocity of 600 km s 1never exceeds a factor of 1.5.
__label__positive Thus for models losing only small fractions of their total angular momen- tum as slow rotators (such as low mass MW metallicity models and all SMC metallicity models), the lifetime e ect cannot ex- plain wholly the increase in angular momentum loss.Another e ect is rotationally enhanced mass loss.
__label__positive As a star approaches the critical rotation velocity, material at the equator becomes less tightly bound due to the centrifugal force, thus one would expect angular momentum lost through winds to increase with rotation velocity.
__label__positive With 3rot=3crit=0:8, the mass loss rates are doubled, so rotation- ally enhanced mass loss plays only a large role when very high critical rotation fractions are achieved.
__label__positive As an example the 5 M  models at MW metallicity in Fig.
__label__positive 3 show that in the range of initial 3rot=3critfrom 0 to 0.4, the total angular momentum lost is almost the same.
__label__positive However when approaching critical rotation, the enhancement factor becomes divergent, so models rotating near the critical velocity experience tremendous mass loss.
__label__positive A further e ect of rotationally induced mixing is to increase the overall mean molecular weight, in the star, compared to models with no rotationally induced mixing.
__label__positive Homologous mod- els suggest a strong dependance on luminosity with mean molec- ular weight such that L/4(Kippenhahn & Weigert 1990).
__label__positive In turn, mass-loss rates are dependant on the luminosity, for the wind prescription used in the models the dependance is approx- imately ˙M/L2(Vink et al.
__label__positive Thus rotationally induced mixing leads to higher mass loss and angular momentum loss.
__label__positive For models which experience quasi-chemical homogeneous evo- lution, where the star can become a helium star, this e ect be- comes very apparent.
__label__positive Models which undergo quasi-chemical ho- mogeneous evolution for the duration of hydrogen burning (de- ﬁned by a monotonically increasing surface helium mass frac- tion) are marked with black circles in Fig.
__label__positive Similarly models which undergo a phase of quasi-chemical homogeneous evolu- tion (deﬁned by having a slowly increasing di erence between surface and central helium mass fraction for longer than one third of the hydrogen burning lifetime) are marked by a red circle.
__label__positive Although these models do not have high initial critical rotation fractions, they still lose large fractions of their angular momen- Article number, page 4 of 14

__label__positive Models with a growing helium surface abundance throughout the duration of their evolution are marked by a black circle.
__label__positive Models with a growing helium surface abundance for part of their evolution are marked by a red circle.
__label__positive Quasi-homogeneous evolution occurs more readily in the lower metallicity models because mass loss being a strong func- tion of metallicity, so the MW metallicity models slow down relatively quickly, rotational mixing becomes less e ective and the homogeneous evolution stops (Yoon et al.
__label__positive The Effect of Convective Core Mass During the main-sequence evolution of a massive star, the con- vective core contracts while the radiative envelope expands.
__label__positive The conservation of angular momentum will therefore demand that in the absence of any internal angular momentum transport, the convective core and radiative envelope increases and decreases respectively their overall angular velocity (i.e.
__label__positive the core "spins up" while the envelope "spins down").
__label__positive This tells us that to en- force solid body rotation during core contraction and envelope expansion, angular momentum must be transported from the core to the envelope.
__label__positive This is achieved by magnetic interactions which transport angular momentum along the angular velocity gradient within the star.
__label__positive In a rotating star with a negligible envelope mass, the core will dominate the an-gular momentum budget.
__label__positive Thus to maintain a constant rotational velocity during envelope expansion, a relatively low angular mo- mentum transport rate is required.
__label__positive On the other hand, for an envelope dominated star to rotate at a constant velocity while the envelope is expanding, the angular momentum transport rate from core to envelope must be high.
__label__positive It is then likely that inter- nal angular momentum transport mechanisms are unable to meet this demand, and as a result the rotational velocity of the stellar surface will decrease due to the e ect of local angular momen- tum conservation.
__label__positive In our models, there is an inner region of the star from which angular momentum is being transported and there is an outer re- gion which the angular momentum is being transported to.
__label__positive Inbe- tween these regions there must be a point which neither gains nor loses any speciﬁc angular momentum.
__label__positive The location of this angu- lar momentum "valve" will give an indication as to the strength of the core mass e ect as discussed above.
__label__positive a, b show the speciﬁc angular momentum proﬁles of a 5 and 15 M model at one time early in their evolution and one time near the end of hydrogen burning.
__label__positive Hydrogen mass fraction proﬁles are plotted to show how advanced the evolution is.
__label__positive 2b,d and have equal initial critical velocity fractions of 0.6.
__label__positive It can be seen that there is a point for each mass at which the speciﬁc angular momentum does not change.
__label__positive Figure 4.c shows this more clearly, where the di erence in angular momentum at both times, divided by the angular mo- mentum at the earlier time, j=j1, is plotted.
__label__positive Here, regions where angular momentum is gained have a positive value, whereas re- gions were angular momentum is lost have a negative value.
__label__positive For the more massive model, the point with a constant speciﬁc an- gular momentum is closer to the star’s edge than for the less massive model.
__label__positive For the 15 M model, approximately 90% of the total mass is acting as a donor of angular momentum, while for the 5 Mmode the ﬁgure is 80%.
__label__positive Using the arguments above, therefore the 15 M model will approach the critical rotation ve- locity more easily.
__label__positive Furthermore by inspecting the area under the curves, in the region where j=j1is positive in Fig.
__label__positive 4.c one can determine how much relative angular momentum is gained.
__label__positive For example, if a region fromm M=mitom M=1 had doubled its total angular momentum, the integralR1 mij=j1d(m M) would be equal to (2 1)(1 mi).
__label__positive 4.c shows that the relative angu- lar momentum gain of the matter in the envelope of the 5 M  model is greater than that of the 15 M model.
__label__positive This tells us that to maintain near solid body rotation, a relatively smaller amount of angular momentum must be transported in the more massive model.
__label__positive The Effect of Efﬁcient Rotational Mixing When a star rotates initially at high velocities, quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution can occur.
__label__positive During such evolution, ro- tational mixing is so e cient that any chemical gradient be- tween core and envelope cannot develop, meaning that the ra- diative envelope does not expand and the star’s radius remains roughly constant (Maeder 1987; Yoon et al.
__label__positive However because the luminosity of a quasi-chemically homogeneously evolving star approaches the Eddington limit, the critical veloc- ity of such a star does decrease (through Eq.
__label__positive Furthermore the increased luminosity causes a strong increase in the mass-loss rate, meaning that the equatorial velocities of stars undergoing quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution are likely to decrease with time.
__label__positive Thus such stars will evolve with a decreasing criti- Article number, page 5 of 14

__label__positive cal velocity fraction while quasi-chemically homogeneous evo- lution occurs.
__label__positive It can be seen that the highest critical velocity fractions occur dur- ing the early part of the stars’ lifetimes because the critical ve- locities (dashed lines) decrease relatively slowly while the equa- torial velocities (dot-dashed lines) fall due to angular momentum loss.
__label__positive In the MW model, quasi-chemically homogeneous evolu- tion is shutdown when the star reaches an age of around 80% of the hydrogen burning lifetime and from this point on the star evolves normally and advances towards the critical velocity.
__label__positive The phase of quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution ends because as the rotational velocity decreases, rotational mixing processes become less e cient and a chemical gradient eventually devel- ops in the star which provides a barrier to mixing through buoy- ancy forces (Heger et al.
__label__positive 2000) and e ectively "turns o " quasi- chemically homogeneous evolution.
__label__positive For a star to evolve to a high critical velocity fraction, it must have a signiﬁcant initial rotation velocity but also be rotating slowly enough to avoid quasi-chemically homogeneous evolu- tion.
__label__positive As the minimum rotation rate required for quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution decreases with increasing mass (Yoon et al.
__label__positive 2006), very massive stars rotate at high critical velocity fractions for only very short fractions of their lifetimes, thus ex- plaining the rarity of Oe stars.
__label__positive Nitrogen Enrichment Here we address the question of whether or not Be stars formed through a single star evolving towards the critical velocity are expected to show signiﬁcant surface nitrogen enrichment, where nitrogen is the product of hydrogen burning and is brought to the stellar surface through rotationally induced mixing.
__label__positive 5 shows the evolution of both surface nitrogen abundance and crit- ical velocity fraction as a function of the fractional hydrogen- burning lifetime.
__label__positive Displayed are models with initial masses 5, 15 and 25 Mwith SMC, LMC and MW metallicities.
__label__positive (2011) the relative increase of the nitrogen abun- dance goes down with increasing metallicity, therefore we see weaker nitrogen enrichment in the MW models than the LMC or SMC models.
__label__positive It is also clear that rotationally induced mixing is more e cient in more massive stars, owing to the e ects of in- creased radiation pressure in more massive stars (Maeder 1987; Yoon et al.
__label__positive 5, we expect that in the Milky-way, nitrogen is never enhanced by much more than a factor of 10 for models that rotate near the critical velocity.
__label__positive On the other hand, the LMC and SMC models that attain near criti- cal rotation velocities show surface nitrogen enhancements of at least a factor 10 and up to approximately a factor 30.
__label__positive We therefore judge that single Be stars in the LMC should have surface nitrogen abundances =12+log(N=H) no smaller than around 7.7, and in the SMC no smaller than around 7.4.
__label__positive In the Milky-way, we no not expect the single Be stars to have outstanding nitrogen surface abundances.
__label__positive Predicted Fractions of Be Stars In this section, we discuss synthetic populations of coeval rotat- ing single stars as described in Sec.
__label__positive These results can then be compared to the number of Be stars observed in young star clusters of various ages.
__label__positive From our models, we derive the frac- tion of Be stars within one bolometric magnitude (assumed to be equal to one visual magnitude) of the turn-o .
__label__positive We consider a stellar model to correspond to a Be star when its rotational ve- locity exceeds a predeﬁned fraction of critical rotation.
__label__positive Figure 6 shows the result as a function of age for various threshold critical velocity fractions and metallicities.
__label__positive A striking feature of this plot is the maximum in Be frac- tion for all metallicities near 10 Myr.
__label__positive At t=0 there are no Be stars because, as discussed earlier, the initial rotation distribu- tion prevents O stars entering the ZAMS with 3rot=3critfractions greater than around 0.7.
__label__positive The 30 M models take approximately 5 Myr to evolve towards critical rotation, shortly after which point they leave the main-sequence.
__label__positive From 5 to 10 Myr the Be fraction grows sharply as angular momentum loss from winds diminishes.
__label__positive From 10 to 20 Myr the Be fraction falls because the of the core-mass e ect as discussed in Section 3.3.
__label__positive Comparing the hydrogen burning lifetimes of non-rotating MW models, it is found that populations with ages from 10 to 20 Myr have a main sequence turn o mass of around 17 M .
__label__positive These models are in a "Goldilocks" situation where they are massive enough to have an appreciable convective core but not so massive to lose large amounts of angular momentum.
__label__positive Furthermore we see that the Be fraction increases at earlier times for the lower metallicity models and that there is a clear trend in metallicity which shows that single Be stars become Article number, page 6 of 14

__label__positive Both of these fea- tures are a result of the fact that the strength of angular momen- tum loss is metallicity dependant as discussed in Section 3.2.
__label__positive It is also found that the Be fraction is strongly depen- dant on the chosen Be criterion.
__label__positive When critical velocity frac- tion, 3rot=3critof 0.7 is chosen as the Be criterion, we predict Be fractions in the Magellanic Clouds in the range 15 to 35%.
__label__positive Wheres when we restrict Be stars to being nearly critical rota- tors ( 3rot=3crit>0:98), the Magellanic Cloud Be fraction lies in the range 0 to 10% and is almost 0 for population ages greater than 50 Myr.

__label__positive Over plotted on our theoretical predictions are Hubble Space Telescope observations of the SMC cluster NGC 330 (Milone et al.
__label__positive 2009), We see that the nearly criticallyrotating stars are located very close to the turn-o , as can be ex- pected by the fact that our models only achieve high fractions of critical rotation near core hydrogen exhaustion (see Figs.
__label__positive 7 also shows the e ects of gravity darkening, with the slowly rotating models almost conﬁned to a single isochrone while the fast rotators su er strong gravity darkening and display a wider range of colours, due to a relatively large spread in e ective tem- peratures.

__label__positive In the following analysis we shall assume that the H emit- ters in NGC 330 are Be stars.
__label__positive 7 show that most of the observed H emitters are redder than the ordi- nary main sequence stars.
__label__positive This segregation is not a unique fea- ture to NGC 330, with many LMC and SMC clusters exhibiting the same trait (Milone et al.
__label__positive (1998) have suggested through observations of Be stars whose spectra show rapid switching between containing emission lines and not, that the decretion disc can contribute up to 40% of a Be star’s ﬂux.

__label__positive compare the colours of our fast rotating models with those of observed Be stars.
__label__positive However, assuming that the error on the mag- nitudes of our synthetic Be stars is at most 0.35 mag, we may consider the relationship between the relative number of Be stars and apparent magnitude.
__label__positive 8 shows the Be fraction of our model predictions in F814W apparent magnitude bins for various threshold rotation rates for stellar models to be considered a Be star.
__label__positive We see that our model Be stars are strongly biased to being located near the main-sequence turn o , around mF814W=15:4 mag, where de- pending on how fast we require a Be star to rotate, the Be fraction is between 30 and 90%.
__label__positive 8 compares our model predictions to Be star counts in NGC 330 (Milone et al.
__label__positive The observa- tions show that in NGC 330 the Be fraction is approximately 0.6, and it remains rather constant within a wide magnitude range of 17.0 to 15.6 mag.
__label__positive This result is quantitatively conﬁrmed by a recent study of Bodensteiner et al.
__label__positive (2019), who used MUSE spectroscopy to identify Be stars in the core of NGC 330.
__label__positive 8 reveals that when assuming that Be stars are required to rotate only at 70% or more of the critical rotation velocity, our single star mod- els agree with the observed Be star count in NGC 330 at the turn oregion.
__label__positive Firstly, even adopting the least stringent threshold value for Be stars, our models fail to produce the large number of observed Be stars.
__label__positive Secondly, our models can not reproduce the fact that the Be star fraction in NGC 330 is constant over a range of 1.5 magnitudes.
__label__positive The total number of Be star can in principle be boosted by lowering the rotationthreshold for considering the models a Be star, or by adopting larger initial rotation velocities.
__label__positive However, it is an intrinsic fea- ture of the rotating single star models to increase the ratio of rotation to critical rotation velocity with time (Fig.
__label__positive Thus, it appears quite unlikely that single star evolution that the observed distribution of Be stars in NGC 330 can be explained solely by single star evolution.
__label__positive Uncertainties It is important to keep in mind that models are simply that and at some point they must fail to reﬂect the behaviour of real stars.
__label__positive Martins & Palacios (2013) have found that the hydrogen burning lifetimes given by models studied here di er to those of MESA models by approximately 15%.
__label__positive As this is merely a discrepancy in the clock, but not in the physical behaviour of the models (Marchant 2017), this is concerning, but should not change the main results presented here.
__label__positive Another issue is the treatment of mass-loss, which is a strong factor in determining a model’s evolution towards the critical ve- locity.
__label__positive 2000) was calibrated for models in the range 15-20 M , so it may be ques- tionable whether this scheme is accurate for models outside this range.
__label__positive Furthermore the correct treatment of a star rotating close to the critical velocity is complex.
__label__positive Near the critical velocity, two distinct winds are expected to form, a cold equatorial wind (which carries away angular momentum) and a warm polar wind Article number, page 8 of 14

__label__positive It is not appar-ent which wind has the dominating e ect, although the winds of models presented here always carry away angular momen- tum.
__label__positive 1 demands that as a star approaches the critical rotation velocity, the mass loss rate becomes inﬁnite.
__label__positive It can also be ques- tioned whether this is a correct treatment of the mass loss of a critically rotating star.
__label__positive (2018) matched light-curve mod- els to observations of 54 Be stars and determined that the typical mass-loss rate of a Be star in the mass range 10 to 20 M is of the order 10 10Myr 1.
__label__positive Our models predict that only stars with initial masses less than around 10 M have such mass-loss rates on the main-sequence.
__label__positive This discrepancy highlights the fact that the models studied here are 1-dimensional and hence may strug- gle to represent accurately the mass-loss of a rotating star (which is a 2-dimensional problem).
__label__positive Our deﬁnition of a Be star is one that is rotating close to the critical velocity.
__label__positive However it would appear that nature has a slightly di erent deﬁnition, with pulsations perhaps playing a role (Rivinius et al.
__label__positive Pulsations could serve to kick matter o of the stellar surface and aid the formation of a circumstellar disc.
__label__positive Observations with the CoRoT space telescope show that Be stars display pulsations that can transport angular momentum through the star (Huat et al.
__label__positive 2009), thus a ecting the evolution of rotation velocities.
__label__positive The interaction of rotation and pulsations is out of the scope of this work and the results of such endeavours are eagerly awaited.
__label__positive Furthermore recent observations with the TESS space telescope imply that Article number, page 9 of 14
__label__positive Be_paper the Be star disc could be fed by mass ejections from starspots (Balona & Ozuyar 2019).
__label__positive Be stars are complex objects, with ro- tation being a key ingredient of the Be phenomenon, but perhaps not the only one.
__label__positive Our population synthesis results are dependant on the ini- tial rotation distribution that is assumed.
__label__positive (2013) used high quality data, a large and unbiased sample of star, and corrected for e ects as macro turbulence, other rota- tional velocity distributions are available (Martayan et al.
__label__positive 2010)While our quantitative re- sults might change using one of them, we do not expect a change in the qualitative behaviour of our results, which appears to be determined by the evolutionary factors discussed in Sect.
__label__positive Comparison with Previous Models The frequencies of single Be stars have been predicted from models by Ekström et al.
__label__positive A major di erence between these sets of models and the models studied here is the inclusion of the e ects of an internal magnetic ﬁeld which strongly couples the core and envelope, which may increase the predicted numbers of critically rotating stars.
__label__positive (2008) predict at solar metallicity and an age of 25 Myr the fraction of stars with a brightness of up to two magnitudes below the turn-o and rotating at the critical velocity is 5%, compared to 0% found here.
__label__positive However when one looks at the fraction of stars rotating faster than 3rot=3crit=0.7 at 20 Myr, Ekström et al.
__label__positive (2008) ﬁnds a Be fraction of around 15%, com- pared to 8% found here.
__label__positive Both sets of models agree that at ages greater than around 40 Myr, almost no stars rotate at the critical velocity.
__label__positive (2008) used a Gaussian-like initial rota- tion distribution with a peak at  = crit=0:6, which in the Roche model corresponds to 3rot=3crit0.4, and therefore is judged to be a similar initial rotation distribution to the one used in this work.
__label__positive (2008) mass loss rates play a crucial role in the evolution of the surface rotation.
__label__positive In our models above 10 M, a turn over in 3rot=3critis caused by strong mass- loss at late times (see Figure 2).
__label__positive When using the Kudritzki & Puls (2000) mass-loss scheme, Ekström et al.
__label__positive (2008) found this turn over not to occur, and so those models spend more time at high 3rot=3critvalues and so Be stars become more common.
__label__positive It is therefore concluded that mass-loss is just as important as angular momentum transport in producing stars which rotate close to the critical velocity at galactic metallicity.
__label__positive At Z=0:002 (a metallic- ity similar to our SMC models) Ekström et al.
__label__positive (2008) calculate a maximum in Be fraction at an age of 10Myr of around 10%, in good agreement with the results presented here.
__label__positive (2013) ﬁnd that Be stars should become rarer at lower metallicities, which is in contradiction to the results presented here and the general trend seen by observers (Iqbal & Keller 2013; Maeder et al.
__label__positive Comparison with Further Observations Iqbal & Keller (2013) observed Be star fractions within 1 vi- sual magnitude of the turno in LMC and SMC clusters.
__label__positive Such observations are directly comparable with Fig.
__label__positive In clusters of ages from 7 to 8 Myr the Be fraction decreases from 15 % to 0 %.
__label__positive When deﬁning the Be criterion to be 0.9 3rot=3crit, a similar behaviour is found albeit at later ages.
__label__positive Iqbal & Keller (2013) also ﬁnd that Be frac-tions increase with decreasing metallicity, in agreement with our models.
__label__positive (2010) found that Be stars are three to ﬁve times more frequent in the SMC than the galaxy, again in fairly good agreement with the model predictions.
__label__positive (2010) reported that the distribution of Be star frequency across spectral types does not depend on metallicity.
__label__positive 6 shows similar trends for all metallicities, this behaviour is conﬁrmed by the models.
__label__positive Observations from Tarasov (2017) show that Be stars be- come most common in clusters with ages of 12-20Myr, in rel- atively good agreement to the model predictions.
__label__positive (2016) found that in the SMC the fre- quency of Oe stars is strongly peaked around spectral types O9.
__label__positive Furthermore the Oe to O star fraction was measured as 0.26, compared to 0.03 for the MW.
__label__positive This measurement supports our result that very few stars with high critical velocity fractions and ages less than 10Myr should be found in the MW, but are found at lower metallicities (see lower Panels of Fig.
__label__positive Owing to the fact that the results of our population synthe- sis rely strongly on the adopted initial rotation distribution, one may question whether it is appropriate to assume that stars in the MW and Magellanic Clouds have equivalent initial critical rota- tion fractions.
__label__positive Whether the observed trends in Be fraction with metallicity are due to stellar evolution or a metallicity dependant rotation distribution is not clear.
__label__positive If lower metallicity stars were to rotate signiﬁcantly faster, rotationally enhanced mass-loss would hinder the formation of Be stars at lower metallicities, therefore there is a limit to how much faster stars at lower metallicities can rotate.
__label__positive (2004) found no signiﬁ- cant di erence between rotational velocities of O-type stars in the galaxy and Magellanic Clouds, Keller (2004) concludes that LMC stars are more rapidly rotating than galactic stars.
__label__positive It is cu- rious to consider that even if LMC stars have faster equatorial velocities, due to their compactness they have larger critical ve- locities, and hence perhaps the same initial 3rot=3critas galactic stars.
__label__positive Comparing the Single and Binary Star Formation Channels of Be Sstars.
__label__positive Whereas in this work we focus on the single star formation chan- nel for Be stars, it is evident that Be stars can also be formed through close binary evolution.
__label__positive The main mechanism is spin- up by accretion, which is expected to occur as a consequence of mass transfer (Langer 2012).
__label__positive The class of Be /X-ray binaries (Reig 2011) provides strong support for this picture.
__label__positive (1991) showed through detailed models that Be stars may be pro- duced by mass accretion from a companion star in the course of close binary evolution.
__label__positive Using simpliﬁed binary evolution calcu- lations, Shao & Li (2014) demonstrated that potentially a large enough number of them could emerge from binary evolution to explain the currently observed Be star populations.
__label__positive In the follow- ing, we discuss several basic di erences which can be expected between Be stars formed through binary interaction compared to those formed through the single star channel.
__label__positive As we have seen above, when using the rotational veloc- ity distribution of Dufton et al.
__label__positive (2013), it is di cult for single star models to achieve very close to critical rotation (lower right panel of Fig.
__label__positive To remedy this would require that a signiﬁcant fraction of stars is already born with near critical rotation.
__label__positive For low enough mass or metallicity, this group of stars would the re- main rapidly rotating throughout their main sequence life.
__label__positive Such a picture appears not to be supported by observations (McSwain Article number, page 10 of 14
__label__positive Hastings, Wang, and Langer: The Single Star Path to Be Stars & Gies 2005).
__label__positive Accordingly, single star evolution appears to be able to explain signiﬁcant Be star populations only if decretion discs could form also in stars rotating signiﬁcantly below criti- cal.
__label__positive In mass transferring binary evolution models, this is dif- ferent.
__label__positive The angular-momentum of the mass-gainer increases quickly, such that critical rotation can be achieved after a rel- ative mass increase of the mass gainer of 10% or less (Packet 1981).
__label__positive During mass-transfer there is no ﬁne-tuning mechanism that switches o accretion when a given rotation rate is reached, instead the only limit is critical rotation.
__label__positive Therefore, all mass transferring binaries where tides do not limit the spin-up of the mass gainer — which is the vast majority — are expected to produce a critically rotating main sequence star (Langer 2012).
__label__positive After the accretion phase, the two mechanisms which a ect the single stars, i.e., spin-down by mass loss and spin-up due to core contraction, will also work in the spun-up mass gainer.
__label__positive Whereas the wind induced drain of angular momentum may spin down some of the most massive mass gainers, the core contraction ac- companying central hydrogen burning ensures that most of them remain at critical rotation for the rest of their main sequence evo- lution.
__label__positive Consequently, whereas single star evolution leads to an in- crease of the rotation velocity compared to its critical value in many cases, the binary channel can produce a much larger num- ber of stars living at critical rotation for a long time, compared to the single star channel.
__label__positive (2020) ﬁnd that the initial mass ratio limit for stable mass transfer leads naturally to a restriction of binary-produced Be stars to within about two magnitudes of the cluster turn-o , which compares well with ob- servations when interpreting the H emitting stars in NGC 330 as Be stars (Milone et al.
__label__positive A further important di erence between the Be stars pro- duced via single and binary evolution concerns their expected surface abundances.
__label__positive As discussed above, the mass-gainer of a binary system may only accrete a small amount of mass to spin up.
__label__positive In this case, only material from the outer envelope of the donor star is incorporated into the mass gainer.
__label__positive As this mate- rial is generally not enriched in hydrogen burning products, one would expect that Be stars formed through the binary channel are not signiﬁcantly polluted by accretion.
__label__positive Detailed binary evolution models with LMC metallicity (Langer & et al 2019) suggest that the surface nitrogen mass fraction of spun-up mass gainers is at most tripled compared to the baseline nitrogen abundance.
__label__positive Ad- ditionally, the spun-up mass gainers had ordinary rotation rates before the mass transfer episode.
__label__positive As such, they established a strong mean molecular weight barrier between core and enve- lope, which prevents any signiﬁcant rotationally induced mixing after their spin-up.
__label__positive 3.5 we argue that single Be stars ought to have much larger surface nitrogen enhancements (by as much as a factor 30; cf., Fig.
__label__positive A diagnostic to discriminate single and binary Be stars would then be their surface nitrogen abundances.
__label__positive (2011) ﬁnd that in the LMC cluster NGC 2004, only two Be stars from a sample of 11 were measured to have a nitrogen abundance=12+log(N=H) greater than 7.8, while the other 9 Be stars had less than 7.4.
__label__positive This observed bimodal distribution supports the idea of the binary and single Be star formation chan- nels producing populations with di erent nitrogen enrichments, and would suggest that in NGC 2004 the binary formation chan- nel dominates.
__label__positive (2011) found that the nitro- gen abundances of the majority of the LMC Be stars observed in the VLT-FLAMES Survey of Massive Stars are not consis- tent with single star evolution.
__label__positive Also, the Be star NGC 330-B 12was found to be almost devoid of nitrogen lines and possessing a spectrum inconsistent with single star evolution models (Lennon et al.
__label__positive 2005), giving further evidence that Be stars can be formed by binary interactions.
__label__positive Finally we note that a key di erence between Be stars pro- duced by the two channels concerns their potential binary com- panions.
__label__positive Since the initial rotational velocity distribution for sin- gle stars and stars in binaries appears to be similar (Ramírez- Agudelo et al.
__label__positive 2015), we would expect a signiﬁcant fraction of Be stars formed through the single star channel (i.e., with- out accretion-induced spin-up) to have unevolved main sequence companions.
__label__positive Vice versa, whereas massive binary-produced Be stars may be sin- gle since they lost their companion when it produced a super- nova explosion, the lower mass binary-produced Be stars should all have evolved companions: subdwarfs or white dwarfs.
__label__positive While those are very hard to detect (Schootemeijer et al.
__label__positive 2018), recent studies of disc truncation of apparently single Be stars suggest that indeed unseen companions are present in the majority of cases (Klement et al.
__label__positive Conclusions We have identiﬁed and discussed three factors which a ect a star’s evolution towards the critical velocity throughout main- sequence evolution.
__label__positive Mass-loss through stellar winds has the ef- fect of removing angular momentum from a star, and so hinders the approach to the critical velocity.
__label__positive The fraction of convective core mass to the total stellar mass strongly a ects the internal angular momentum transport, which is crucial for an expanding envelope to maintain a fast rotational velocity.
__label__positive Lastly the occur- rence of quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution prevents the stellar envelope from expanding and thus critical velocity de- creasing, and also increases the angular momentum lost through stellar winds.
__label__positive When using an observed distribution of B star rotational ve- locities for constructing synthetic stellar populations, we ﬁnd that our single star models predict few stars rotating at near crit- ical velocities, although we do predict as much as 35% of OB stars to rotate with more than 70% of their critical velocity.
__label__positive We therefore conclude that if Be stars are near-critical rotators, then single star models cannot explain the observed numbers of Be stars.
__label__positive In this case, most Be stars must be the product of mass- transfer in binary systems.
__label__positive If Be stars instead only rotate at say 70-80% of their criti- cal velocity, then the observed Be star fractions can be reason- ably described by single star evolution (see Fig 6).
__label__positive However, in the40 Myr old SMC cluster NGC 330, Be stars are observed in signiﬁcant numbers down to almost two magnitudes below the main-sequence turn-o .
__label__positive Independent of the rotation thresh- old for the Be phenomenon, our single star models predict that Be stars should be located only in a narrow luminosity range near the turn-o (see Fig 8), which disagrees with observations of NGC 330.
__label__positive Whereas signiﬁcant uncertainties remain, speciﬁcally in rec- onciling how stars that appear to rotate at 70% of their critical velocity can still form decretion discs and why so few Be stars are observed to rotate near the critical velocity, it appears evident that the observed Be star populations can not be explained by single star evolution alone, and that it may not be the dominant channel for Be star formation.
__label__positive Nevertheless, single star evolu- tion will contribute, most strongly so in the age range from 8 to 20 Myr, at least at sub-solar metallicity.
__label__positive Be_paper Furthermore, our single star models predict that the sur- faces of rapidly rotating single stars should be contaminated with freshly synthesised nitrogen, the more the faster the rotation.
__label__positive In spun-up mass gainers of binary systems, this is not necessarily so.
__label__positive The observations of non- or weakly nitrogen enriched sur- faces in several groups of Be stars therefore strengthens the con- clusion that the majority of these objects can not originate from single star evolution.

__label__positive Appendix A: Initial Conditions Required to Reach Near Critical Velocities In Section 3.1 we have discussed the evolution of rotational velocities of various models, when the models all have the same relative initial rotation rates.
__label__positive Here we explore how the approach to the critical velocity depends on the initial rotation rate by performing interpolations between the models.
__label__positive A.1 shows, for di ering stellar masses and metallicities, the critical velocity fraction as a function of time and initial rotation rate.
__label__positive The colour of each point on the plot shows the critical velocity fraction at a particular fractional hydrogen-burning lifetime, t=tMS, and initial critical velocity fraction value.
__label__positive By following horizontal lines in the plot, one traces the evolution of a single model through its evolution.
__label__positive For 5 Mmodels at both SMC and MW metallicities, the star evolves generally towards higher critical velocity fractions.
__label__positive This can be seen as one traces a horizontal line, one moves always into regimes of higher critical velocity fractions.
__label__positive The exception is the 5 MMW models with 3rot=3crit>0:7, which at the end of hydrogen burning spin down through increased rotationally enhanced mass-loss.
__label__positive Looking at 15 M models at SMC metallicity, one sees also that there is a constant evolution towards higher critical velocity fractions.
__label__positive On the other hand 15 M models with MW metallicity evolve to higher critical velocity fractions until around 80% of the hydrogen-burning lifetime, then they spin down due to angular momentum loss through winds (as discussed in Sec.
__label__positive The 25 Mmodels behave in a more complicated way because the initially very fast rotating models can undergo quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution (as discussed in Sec.
__label__positive A.1 one can see the two regimes according to whether or not the critical velocity fraction is increasing or decreasing.
__label__positive We can see that for 25 M MW models with initial 3rot=3crit0:7, they evolve at ﬁrst to lower critical velocity fractions then after t=tMS0:6 they begin to evolve towards higher critical velocity fractions.
__label__positive This occurs because initially the star is evolving quasi-chemically homogeneously, during which time rotation rates and hence rotationally induced mixing e ciency drops until quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution is shut down, at which point the star begins to evolve with an expanding envelope and approaches the critical velocity.
__label__positive For similarly initially fast rotating SMC models the same behaviour does not occur due to the weaker stellar winds at lower metallicities.
__label__positive A.1 also shows us that the models only reach critical rotation (the black areas in the ﬁgure) very near core hydrogen exhaustion.
__label__positive Furthermore, when one looks at the minimum initial rotation rate required to reach near critical rotation, it decreases with increasing mass due to angular momentum transport e ciency ( as discussed in Sec.

__label__positive We determine the isinvalues of 42, 35, and 67 stars in each cluster, respectively, and from their distributions we ﬁnd that isotropic spins and moderate alignment are both consistent with the Pleiades and Praesepe data.
__label__positive While it is dif ﬁcult to distinguish between these scenarios for a single cluster, an ensemble of such distributions may facilitate a distinction.
__label__positive The M35 inclination distribution is most consistent with a superposition of isotropic and anisotropic spins, the source of which could be systematic error or a physical grouping of aligned stars.
__label__positive We also study internal cluster kinematics using radial velocities and proper motions.
__label__positive Ourkinematics analysis reveals signi ﬁcant plane-of-sky rotation in Praesepe, with a mean velocity of 0.132 ±0.022 km s−1in a clockwise direction.

__label__positive Introduction Stars in open clusters offer unique insight into the outcomes of star formation through their assumed coeval formation.
__label__positive These stars’shared age, metallicity, and fo rmation environment make each cluster a benchmark in temporal, chemical, and dynamicalevolution.
__label__positive Among the quantities that offer a glimpse into acluster ’s past is the projected inclination, the projected angle between a star ’s rotation axis and the observer ’s line of sight.
__label__positive An isotropic distribution of inclinations in a cluster (e.g., Jackson & Jeffries 2010 )suggests a star-forming e nvironment dominated by turbulent ﬂow, while anisotropic groupings of spins (e.g., Corsaro et al.
__label__positive 2017 )present evidence for the inheritance and preservation of molecular cloud angular momentum by nascent cluster stars.
__label__positive Magnetic ﬁelds may in ﬂuence spin alignment in open clusters, as suggested by a study of proto-planetary disks that found a 2 σ deviation from isotropy among th e position angles of disks in the molecular cloud Lupus III (Aizawa et al.
__label__positive This work found a correlation between the disk orientations and magnetic ﬁeld direction in this cloud.
__label__positive However, it also measured randomlyoriented position angles in four other star-forming regions, suggesting a lesser in ﬂuence of magnetic ﬁelds in those cases.
__label__positive Healy & McCullough (2020, hereafter Paper I)determined 33 inclinations in the open cluster NGC 2516, ﬁnding a distribution consistent with either isotropy or moderate alignment.
__label__positive Studying additional clusters in a uniform way will reveal whether this result is an outlier or representative of a larger sample.
__label__positive In order to learn from an ensemble of uniformly determined inclinations, in thispaper we determine the spin-axis distributions of stars in thePleiades, Praesepe, and M35 clusters (Table 1 ).
__label__positive Two previous inclination studies of the Pleiades found that isotropic distributions were favored (Jackson & Jeffries 2010; Jackson et al.
__label__positive The Praesepe cluster has also been the subject of two studies, with one ﬁnding a preferred anisotropic distribution (Kovacs 2018 )and the other favoring isotropy (Jackson et al.
__label__positive There has not been a study of stellar inclinations in M35 to date.We use the spectro-photometric method to determine projected inclinations, which is governed by the following equation: ()p= viR Pi sin2sin .
__label__positive 1 Here, visin is the projected rotation velocity measured from Doppler broadening of spectral lines, Ris the radius obtained through isochrone and spectral-energy-distribution (SED ) ﬁtting to stellar magnitudes, and Pis the rotation period observed as a modulating signal in time-series photometry.
__label__positive In this paper, we will often refer to the projected isinvalue on the right-hand side of Equation (1)as the “inclination.
__label__positive ”Fitting models to the resulting inclination distributions reveals theirtendency toward isotropy or alignment.
__label__positive We also perform an analysis of proper motions and line-of- sight (LOS )velocities for each cluster in order to study their internal kinematics.
__label__positive This part of our study follows the approach and motivation of Kamann et al.
__label__positive (2019 )who explored possible connections between the aligned spins seen in two open clusters (Corsaro et al.
__label__positive The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the data sources used in our analysis of the three clusters.
__label__positive Section 3provides the details of our data analysis.
__label__positive Section 5 discusses the implications of our results and we conclude in Section 6.
__label__positive Data Sources For each cluster, we consulted the Gaia DR2-based (Gaia Collaboration et al.
__label__positive 2016,2018a )member lists from Cantat- Gaudin et al.
__label__positive For all subsequent analysis, we used the Gaia DR2-to-EDR3 match table to update target stars with EDR3 astrometry (Gaia Collaboration et al.
__label__positive Since Sun-like stars are most amenable to a spectro-photo metric inclination determina- tion, we did not use Gaia EDR3 data to identify additional clustermembers.
__label__positive The majority of these newly identi ﬁed members wouldThe Astrophysical Journal, 923:23 (17pp ), 2021 December 10 https: //doi.org /10.3847 /1538-4357 /ac281d © 2021.
__label__positive likely be faint (low-mass )stars that would be removed by our analysis anyway.
__label__positive Using TOPCAT (Taylor 2005 ), we performed 1 ″cross matches between the cluster member lists and all additional data sets that lacked pre-determined Gaia source IDs.
__label__positive Thesedata included stellar magnitudes from CatWISE2020 (Marocco et al.
__label__positive 2000 ), APASS DR10 (Henden 2019 ), and GALEX (Martin et al.
__label__positive For the rotation period Pand visin, we used data as noted in the following subsections.
__label__positive Pleiades and Praesepe For the Pleiades, we used rotation period measurements derived from K2 observations (Howell et al.
__label__positive These measurements are based on periodogram analyses using the NASA Exoplanet Archive Periodogram Service (Akeson et al.
__label__positive We adopted conservative 1% random uncertainties in each period, representing the leastprecise measurements (L.
__label__positive We estimate the systematic effects of differential rotation in Section 5.6.
__label__positive We used visin measurements from the CORAVEL instrument, reported by Mermilliod et al.
__label__positive For Praesepe, we used K2-based rotation period measure- ments from Rebull et al.
__label__positive (2017 ), who employed the same analysis techniques as for the Pleiades periods.
__label__positive We once againadopted 1% random uncertainties on each measurement.
__label__positive M35 For M35, we used K2 rotation period measurements from Soares-Furtado et al.
__label__positive We used the periodogram signal-to-noise ratio listed for each period to estimate uncertainties.
__label__positive We selected stars classi ﬁed as rotating with no blending.
__label__positive Thevisin measurements for this cluster came from the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS; Geller et al.
__label__positive To ensure that each visinmeasurement quanti ﬁed the uncertainty in the parameter itself rather than its mean, weconverted the given standard error uncertainties to standard deviations by multiplying by the square root of the number of observations.
__label__positive Finally, we accessed WOCS BVRI magnitudes (Thompson et al.
__label__positive 2014 )to supplement the other photometric surveys for this most distant cluster of our sample.3.
__label__positive Analysis Our analysis begins by removing stars that are most likely to yield spurious measurements, such as binary stars close to equal mass.
__label__positive The possibilities of visin being confused in double-lined spectra, multiple rotation signals to be present in a light curve, and excess brightness to be seen in an SED justifyremoving them.
__label__positive After establishing a set made up of stars presumed to be either single or binaries dominated by the primary, we perform isochrone /SED ﬁtting to determine radii and combine these results with published period and visin measurements with a Bayesian method to determine isin.W e model the resulting cumulative distribution functions (CDFs ) ofvisin values using Monte Carlo methods and we also analyze proper motion and LOS velocity measurements to learnabout each cluster ’s internal kinematics.
__label__positive Star Selection We initially selected stars having a minimum membership probability threshold of 68%.
__label__positive Following the approach of Paper I, we removed likely equal-mass binaries from each cluster ’s color –magnitude diagram along with systems classi- ﬁed as binaries by SIMBAD (Wenger et al.
__label__positive 2000 ).W e excluded four additional stars from the M35 sample that wereindicated to be binaries by Leiner et al.
__label__positive To further reduce the number of likely binaries in our sample, we analyzed the Gaia EDR3 Reduced Unit Weight Error (RUWE )measurement using a technique motivated by Belokurov et al.
__label__positive (2020 ).W e ﬁrst performed a Gaussian kernel density estimation on the distribution of RUWE values (with a bandwidth of 0.2 )for each cluster to create a probability density function (PDF ).
__label__positive We isolated the portion of the PDF corresponding to values the RUWE value at the peak of the PDF, which for each cluster is ∼1.
__label__positive We then re ﬂected this curve about the maximum and normalized it, creating a RUWE PDF representative of likely single stars.
__label__positive We discarded the stars withRUWE values that were greater than the 99th percentile of this single-star distribution.
__label__positive Isochrone /SED Fitting To determine stellar radii, effective temperatures, and other parameters, we used the isochrones software (Morton 2015 ) toﬁt MIST isochrones (Choi et al.
__label__positive 2016 )and their predicted ﬂux values to each star ’s broad-band SED and Gaia EDR3 parallax measurement.
__label__positive 2021 )to estimate and correct the zero-point parallax bias of eachmeasurement.
__label__positive We set Gaussian priors on each cluster ’s age, metallicity, and reddening.

__label__positive Table 2details the cluster- level priors and their sources.
__label__positive In addition to those priors, we used the (corrected )Gaia parallaxes and uncertainties for individual stellar distance priors.

__label__positive Inclination Determinations We combined visin, period, and radius measurements to yield the sine of the inclination of each target star (1).I na n effort to minimize the effect of systematic measurement errorson our results, we discarded visin values in cases where our simulations predicted no measurements above a cluster ’s threshold of visin.
__label__positive We also removed radial velocity outliers to exclude additional likely binaries and also excluded starswhose rotation periods were highly discrepant from color – period predictions (e.g., Barnes 2003 )to avoid potentially inaccurate period values.
__label__positive The younger Pleiades and M35clusters display both fast- and slow-rotating sequences, whilePraesepe only shows the latter.
__label__positive Overall, this process removed 5stars from the Pleiades sample, 6 from Praesepe, and 24 fromM35.
__label__positive The red boxes and diamonds in Figure 2visualize this selection on plots of period versus effective temperature.
__label__positive For the Pleiades and Praesepe, we included only stars with > visin 5 km s−1, respectively removing 6 and 18 stars from these clusters ’samples.
__label__positive Rotational velocities lower than this threshold are too similar to the s tellar macroturbulent velocity (e.g., Doyle et al.
__label__positive These two sources of broadening are very difﬁcult to disentangle, even at high resolution.
__label__positive While including smaller values of visinwould increase our sample size, the values may not accurately quan tify the rotation velocity and could bias the inclination distribution.
__label__positive The WOCS study reported visinonly for values greater than 10 km s−1,s ow eu s e dt h a tt h r e s h o l df o rM 3 5 .
__label__positive We further discuss macroturbulence in Section 5.5.
__label__positive We also identi ﬁed potential systematic errors in visin by calculating the maximum expected visinvalue (corresponding to an edge-on inclination )across a grid of effective temperature and period values.
__label__positive We used the MIST isochrone correspondingto each cluster ’s priors for SED ﬁtting (Table 2)to relate effective temperature to radius values.
__label__positive We incorporated theempirical scatter seen in our sample of period and radiusvalues, and for each cluster we drew a contour line (red curves in Figure 2)representing the combinations of Pand T eff yielding a maximum visin below our threshold.
__label__positive The stars above this contour potentially suffer from a systematic errorthat leads to a higher visinmeasurement than possible given the star ’s rotation period and radius.
__label__positive We discarded these measurements due to the sensitivity of the spectro-photometricmethod to systematic errors (e.g., Kamiaka et al.
__label__positive These contours assume a combination of scatter in Rand Pthat yields greater-than-average visin values in order to avoid removing more stars than justi ﬁed.
__label__positive The points in Figure 2are color-coded by their respective isin value.
__label__positive Previous studies,e.g., by Kovacs (2018 ), eliminated stars with outlying isin values greater than a given threshold (e.g., 2.0 ), and our method achieves a similar result of removing unphysical inclination values using a more data-driven approach.
__label__positive After the selection process, we calculated isinfor each star using a Bayesian analysis of the spectro-photometric measure-ments (as in Paper I, following Masuda & Winn 2020 ).
__label__positive Modeling the Inclination Distribution In order to forward-model the selection effects induced by the visin threshold described in the previous section, we generated a Monte Carlo sample of simulated stars for each cluster.
__label__positive We used Gaussian kernel density estimation to approximate the de-reddened Gaia BP−RPcolor distribution for each cluster.
__label__positive In the Pleiades and M35, we separated the starsinto fast- and slow-rotating sequences before determining their color distribution.
__label__positive We then generated 105simulated stars using the density estimation for slow-rotating stars in each cluster,and we supplemented the Pleiades and M35 samples with a proportionate amount of fast rotators.
__label__positive For each of these stars, we used a MIST isochrone to relate the color to an effective temperature, radius, and mass.
__label__positive We added scatter to the color –radius relation consistent with the observed dispersion of each sample.
__label__positive We then assigned arotation period to each star based on polynomial spline ﬁts to the color –period data, again adding appropriate empirical scatter.
__label__positive We calculated the true rotation speed vfor each star using the de-projected form of Equation (1).
__label__positive To convert this speed into the projected rotation velocity visin, we generate projected inclinatio n values using the two-parameter model ﬁrst described by Jackson & Jeffries (2010 ).
__label__positive This model assumes that all stellar spins in a cluster are uniformly distributed within a cone having a mean inclination αand spread half-angle λ.
__label__positive The average projected orien tation of cluster members ’spin axes is reﬂected in α, which can vary from 0 °(pole-on )to 90°(edge-on ).
__label__positive The degree of alignment among the spin axes is quanti ﬁed by λ, for which values close to the minimum of 0 °represent tight alignment, while a maximal half-angle value of 90 °corresponds to total isotropy.
__label__positive Since the spectro-photometric method does not permit a constraint on the azimuthal orientation of stellar spin axes in the plane of the sky, the above two parameters parameterize themodel ’s projected inclinat ion distribution.
__label__positive Each model CDF is generated using a Monte Carlo method.
__label__positive We pair each simulated vto a isinvalue, removing stars with visin below the corresponding threshold for that cluster.
__label__positive An increasingly strict visinthreshold will remove greater fractions of slower-rotating and low-inclination stars from a sample.
__label__positive Finally, we simulate the effect of measurement uncertainties on the inclination distribution by ass uming a Gaussian fractional error distribution for the rotation period and radius, and a log-normaldistribution for fractional error in visin.
__label__positive This latter choice approximates well the vsinidata in our study and was also used by Kovacs (2018 ).
__label__positive We determine the parameters used to generate the simulated observat ional errors by calculating the statistics corresponding to the Gaussian and log-normal distribu- tions on the data for each cluster.
__label__positive Determining Inclination Model Parameters In Paper I, we optimized the model parameters αandλby mapping their possible values to ordered pairs spaced in 1 ° intervals.

__label__positive In this paper, we performed a 10,000-step, 50-walker Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC )analysis, setting uniform priors for αandλthat covered the full range of parameter space without forcing speci ﬁc combinations of the parameters.
__label__positive We again de ﬁned a Gaussian likelihood function (LF)based on the reduced χ2calculated from each model and empirical CDF (Equation (2)): ()( ˆ)() åps ns=- * +- =xxln LF 0.5 ln 2 .

__label__positive Finally, ν=n−m represents the degrees of freedom used to calculate the reducedχ 2, with the number of ﬁtted parameters m=2(αandλ).
__label__positive After discarding a burn-in of 1000 steps, we marginalized theposteriors to get probability distributions (PPDs )forαandλ.
__label__positive To gauge the performance of our MCMC analysis method, we validated it on four simulated inclination distributions.
__label__positive The ﬁrst three contained 30 stars and the last contained 120.
__label__positive The ﬁrst simulated distribution was isotro pic, the second was tightly aligned with parameters α=30°andλ=25°,a n dt h e ﬁnal two shared the same moderate alignment (α=75°andλ=45°)with two sample sizes (30 and 120 stars ).
__label__positive To model the measurement uncertainties for the ﬁrst two validation runs, we used the Pleiades sample ’s error distributions.
__label__positive We also use our simulated true rotation velocity distribution for the Pleiades to model a 5 km s −1visinthreshold.
__label__positive For the second two runs, we used the Praesepe sample ’se r r o r distributions and simulated rotation velocities.
__label__positive In these latter tworuns, we applied a 5 km s−1visinthreshold to the simulated 30 star sample, and no threshold to the 120 star sample.The ﬁrst simulation yielded the expected degeneracy between isotropic and moderately aligned parameters, with aPPD favoring λ=89°at its peak with a median value of ∼79°.
__label__positive The 95% con ﬁdence interval for λextends as low as ∼48°, while it constrained αbetween 21 °and 85 °.
__label__positive The second, tightly aligned test put an upper limit on α31°and also constrained λto between 20 °and 49 °at 95% con ﬁdence.
__label__positive This uncertainty in the spread half-angle re ﬂects another known degeneracy, this time between a tightly aligned spread angle at larger meaninclinations and a larger spread angle with a smaller meaninclination.
__label__positive The third, moderately aligned 30 star simulation did not yield a statistically signi ﬁcant departure from isotropy, ﬁnding the most probable λ=83°andλ>8°at 95% con ﬁdence.
__label__positive This test also recovered α=55°while allowing it to range between 9°and 85 °at 95% con ﬁdence.
__label__positive The fourth test, having the same distribution as the third but four times as many stars (and no visin threshold ), yielded results similar to the third test: the peak λ=89°andλ>7°at 95% con ﬁdence, while α=63° was constrained to values between 19 °and 87 °.
__label__positive While the input moderately aligned parameters are not excluded by theseresults, this distribution cannot be signi ﬁcantly distinguished from isotropy due to the similarity of the two scenarios.
__label__positive In these simulations, the increase from 30 to 120 stars did not yield a commensurate improvement in the accuracy orprecision of the spread half-angle and mean inclination,highlighting the diminishing returns of analyzing a sample of∼10 2isin values versus ∼101.
__label__positive Overall, the tests demonstrate our model ’s ability to distinguish between isotopic and tightly aligned spins aimed along the LOS, but they highlight thedifﬁculty of breaking the degeneracy in parameters describing cases of isotropy and moderate alignment, even whenanalyzing a larger sample of stars with a looser quality cut.
__label__positive We also experimented with adding a degree of freedom to the two-parameter model.

__label__positive We labeled the original two parameters as αanisoandλanisoin this model to signify that they now describe the aligned stars, rather than the entirecluster.
__label__positive The three-parameter model can be employed when a two-parameter ﬁt provides unsatisfactory results.
__label__positive Its use is especially supported when additional data suggest the possi-bility of an anisotropic subset of spins in a cluster.3.6.
__label__positive Cluster Kinematics To facilitate a comparison between the inclinations and overall motion of cluster members, we performed an analysis ofastrometric and spectroscopic data in a similar manner to Paper I.
__label__positive The differences from that paper ’s analysis are the use of Gaia EDR3 proper motions and the correction of thesemeasurements for biases in bright (G<13)stars via Equation (5)of Cantat-Gaudin & Brandt (2021 ).
__label__positive For each star meeting the photometric, classi ﬁcation, and RUWE criteria described in Section 3.1, we used the technique of Kamann et al.
__label__positive (2019 )to determine the plane-of-sky (tangential /radial )and LOS kinematics as a function of radial distance from cluster center.
__label__positive We transform Gaia proper motions (with mean cluster motion subtracted )into polar coordinates with the origin at the center of the cluster to obtain plane-of-sky k inematics.
__label__positive Tangential motion corresponds to the azimuthal direction in this coordinate system.LOS velocities, directed perpendicular to the plane of the sky, aremeasured using the Doppler shi ft of stellar spectral lines.
__label__positive to label our results: in all three directions, v0is the mean velocity of stars andσis the velocity dispersion.
__label__positive In the LOS direction, we also consider the position angle θcand rotation velocity vrot.
__label__positive Due to the smaller number of LOS velocities compared with propermotions, we assume that v rotandσLOSare constant.
__label__positive We again used Equation (2)of Gaia Collaboration et al.
__label__positive to a Cartesia n coordinate system, Equation (6)of van de Ven et al.
__label__positive (2006 )to calculate and subtract motion due to perspective effects (e.g., cluster motion along the LOS ),a n d Equation (10)of van Leeuwen et al.
__label__positive (2000 )to convert the resulting corrected proper motions to polar coordinates.
__label__positive Gaia EDR3provided the LOS velocities for th e Pleiades and Praesepe, while for M35 we used the WOCS study (Leiner et al.
__label__positive 2015 )for its g r e a t e rn u m b e ro fm e a s u r e m e n t s .
__label__positive Isochrone /SED Fitting We visually inspected the isochrone /SED ﬁt results both i n d i v i d u a l l ya n da sa ne n s e m b l et ov e r i f yt h a t (1)the data points were well ﬁta n d (2)stellar parameters such as age, [Fe/H],A V, and distance agreed with the expec ted value for each cluster.
__label__positive For each star, we also examined the logarithm of the Bayesian evidence (Zln )determined by approximating an integral of the likelihood times the prior over th e parameter space.
__label__positive The evidence can assist in selecting the appropriate hypothesis or model todescribe the data, and Feroz et al.
__label__positive (2019 )further discuss multinest ’s estimation of this quantity.
__label__positive The vast majority of stars we studied had comparable evidence values, but a small fraction of the values were signiﬁcantly lower.
__label__positive These smallest evidence values corre- sponded to the poorest SED ﬁts, and they may indicate the unsuitability of our hypothesis /model in these cases, for example due to a binary companion or non-member of a cluster.
__label__positive We discarded stars having signi ﬁcantly lower evidence values than the main grouping to avoid including inaccurate radius values in our inclination analysis.
__label__positive The fraction of stars that remained after this selection was 94% for the Pleiades,96% for Praesepe, and 98% for M35.
__label__positive Period –effective temperature plots showing measurements for each cluster that are color-coded by the preliminary isin value they yield.
__label__positive Determinations of isin greater than unity are possible due to the combined inﬂuence of random and systematic errors on the measurements that yield the inclination.
__label__positive Above the red contours, stars are expected to have visinless than the applied thresholds (5k m s−1for Pleiades and Praesepe; 10 km s−1for M35 ), suggesting that their reported visin values are spurious.
__label__positive Diamonds highlight stars removed due to line-of- sight velocities that are signi ﬁcantly discrepant with the cluster ’s distribution, while boxes indicate other excluded stars with rotation periods that are highlydiscrepant with empirical predictions.
__label__positive 3LOS velocities are often called “radial velocities ”in the literature, but we exclusively use “LOS”in this work to avoid confusion with the radial component of proper motions and their associated velocities.

__label__positive Inclination Distributions After applying each cluster ’svisinthreshold and removing spurious values, we have projected inclinations for 42 stars in the Pleiades, 35 in Praesepe, and 67 in M35.
__label__positive The mean uncertainty in isinwas 13% for the Pleiades, 16% for Praesepe, and 13% for M35.

__label__positive Figure 4shows histograms of each cluster ’s inclination distribution.

__label__positive We show visualizations of two-parameter model probabil- ities across the full domain of αandλin Figure 5.
__label__positive Points on each plot show the combinations of parameters accepted by the MCMC run, with the entire plotted sample thinned to represent 2% of all values in the chain.
__label__positive The 95% con ﬁdence intervals for the marginalized Pleiades parameters display tight to moderate alignment at moderate to high mean inclinations (peaking at λ=89°andα=60°, with λ>24°and 13 °<α<85°).
__label__positive The Praesepe spread half-angle PPD peaks at λ=85°and α=53°, constraining λ>26°and 8°<α<82°at 95% con- ﬁdence.
__label__positive The Pleiades and Praesepe probability plots both show“peninsula ”-shaped model probabilities: while mostly surrounded by low-probability parameter combi nations, there is a collection of parameters with high probability that extends from isotropic cases to moderate alignment at moderate mean inclinations.
__label__positive The similar probabilities among these different scenarios highlights a degen-eracy in the parameters describing isotropic and moderately aligned spins for these clusters.
__label__positive For the Pleiades and Praesepe, we also ran the MCMC analysis o nt h ef u l ld a t as e t sw i t hn o visinthreshold.
__label__positive These runs yielded similar results to the analyses using the 5 km s−1threshold.
__label__positive The PPD peaks were at λ=89°,α=60°for the Pleiades and λ=88°, α=55°for Praesepe.
__label__positive At 95% con ﬁdence for the Pleiades, we found λ>33°and 12 °<α<85°.
__label__positive The third panel of Figure 5shows a distinct result for M35 compared to the previous two clusters.

__label__positive For M35, no two-parameter model CDF ﬁts the data as well as the results for the Pleiades and Praesepe.
__label__positive The reduced χ2value for the PPD-peak M35 model is ∼5, while the corresponding values for the Pleiades and Praesepe are∼1.2 and 1.3, respectively.
__label__positive While the isotropic model closely matches the data for isin 0.75 in M35, the inclinations smaller than this value are not well modeled.
__label__positive Grouping of Low-sin iStars in M35 We performed further analysis on the M35 inclination distribution due to the two-parameter model ’s underestimation of the occurrence of low- isin (0.75 )stars in the cluster.
__label__positive We employed the three-parameter model to provide further insightinto this grouping of stars.
__label__positive Figure 7shows the best- ﬁtting three- parameter model CDF to the M35 inclinations and compares it to the isotropic two-parameter distribution.
__label__positive The most probablevalues of the three-parameter model are f∼0.1,α aniso∼5°, andλaniso=14°, yielding a reduced χ2value of ∼0.3.
__label__positive We identi ﬁed a subset of six stars in M35 having <isin 0.35 and corresponding most closely with the anisotropic fraction of the best-ﬁtting three-parameter model.
__label__positive We explored the plane-of-sky spatial distribution of M35 stars in our sample, splitting the sample of 67 into two groupings on each side of the =isin 0.35 boundary.

__label__positive We also studied the proper motions of the M35 stars.
__label__positive Using the same techniques as the k inematics analysis (Section 3.6),w e converted proper motions in the (R.A., decl.
__label__positive )directions to Cartesian coordinates (x,y)and subtracted the predicted motion due to the approach of M35 along the LOS.
__label__positive We plot the corrected proper motions for the sample of 67 stars in Figure 9,a g a i n splitting the data along the =isin 0.35 boundary.
__label__positive To compare the six low-inclination stars ’proper motions to those of the remaining 61, we performed a bootstrapped, two-sample, two-dimensional K–St e s t (Peacock 1983; Fasano & Franceschini 1987;P r e s se ta l .
__label__positive 2007 )4with 10,000 re-samplings, ﬁnding a p-value of 0.04.
__label__positive To further examine the statistical signi ﬁcance of this six-star low-inclination grouping, we performed a Kuiper test, a version of the K –S test that is invariant to the phase of cyclic parameters, on the position angles (measured counterclockwise from north )of these stars.
__label__positive We compared these values to a uniform distribution of position angles, ﬁnding a p-value for compatibility with this null hypothesis of ∼0.12.
__label__positive The magnitude of Gaia EDR3 parallax uncertainties for stars in this grouping prevent us from constraining their LOS positions relative to cluster center.
__label__positive We address potential sources ofsystematic error in Sections 5.5and5.6, and we discuss a physical interpretation of this subset in Section 5.7.Figure 4.

__label__positive Cluster Kinematics We determined tangential and radial kinematics using a sample of 749 stars in the Pleiades, 518 in Praesepe, and 959 in M35.
__label__positive In the LOS direction, we analyzed samp les of 169, 144, and 246 stars, respectively.
__label__positive These stars passed the Gaia EDR3 RUWE selection asdescribed in Section 3.1in order to remove lik ely binaries.
__label__positive Table 4 lists each cluster ’s overall kinematic values .
__label__positive Uncertainties corre- spond to the 16th and 84th percentiles of each PPD.
__label__positive The top panelsin Figure 10plot the dependence on the binned tangential (blue ) and radial (green )motions as a function of angular distance from each cluster center.
__label__positive Predicted radial motion due to each cluster ’s LOS velocity has been subtracted from each radial value.
__label__positive Each proper motion axis is accompanied by a conversion to physical units using an inversion of the mean of corrected EDR3 parallaxes.The bottom panels plot binned proper motion dispersions as afunction of radial distance.
__label__positive We also plot the LOS velocity dispersion and 68% con ﬁdence intervals for each cluster.
__label__positive The mean tangential velocity of Praesepe is greater than zero at∼5σsigniﬁcance and the binned velocities increase with radial distance.
__label__positive For the Pleiades and M35, the 95% con ﬁdence intervals of the mean tangential velocity and all binned pointsoverlap with zero.
__label__positive M35 shows a signature of rotation about an axis perpendicular to the LOS at 95% con ﬁdence.
__label__positive The Pleiades show the greatest mean radial discrepancy at a 4.5σlevel.
__label__positive Each binned point displays negative radial motion.
__label__positive The Praesepe mean radial motion is in statistical agreement with zero, but the two outermost bins are >3σoutliers.
__label__positive M35 shows a similar trend of agreement with zero among the innerradial bins, but 2 −3σdiscrepancy with the most distant two.
__label__positive The Pleiades and Praesepe show signi ﬁcant discrepancies between their mean radial and tangential velocity dispersions(∼3σand∼6σ, respectively ), but for each cluster these values overlap with the 95% con ﬁdence interval for the LOS dispersion.
__label__positive M35 shows the closest agreement among disper-sions in all three directions.
__label__positive Among the binned velocity dispersion points, all values overlap with each other and the LOS dispersion at 95% con ﬁdence levels.
__label__positive Uncertainty Distributions and Model CDFs In this section, we discuss how the modeling of uncertainty distributions in the measurements that yield isin values (see Equation (1))affect the model CDF shape.
__label__positive In Paper I,w eassumed that visin,P, and Rall had uncertainties that were normally distributed.
__label__positive In this work, we approximate the dominant source of error in each cluster ’s inclination values, visin, as a log normal distribution.
__label__positive Forward-modeling the error distributions is important for accurately analyzing an inclina- tion distribution because including the error parameters in the ﬁtting process will introduce degeneracies with the alignment parameters αandλ, complicating any determination of spin alignment or isotropy (see also Section 3 of Kovacs 2018 ).
__label__positive The choice of uncertainty distribution in ﬂuences the shape of the resulting inclination models.
__label__positive Simulated isin values generated with log-normally distributed errors tend to moderate the curvature of the model CDF compared to inclinations generated from normalerror distributions.
__label__positive This facilitates the modeling of isinvalues that suffer from high levels of random error but are nonetheless important to include in the analysis.
__label__positive Being too selective in removing data points based on isin (especially those greater than unity )can introduce a systematic bi as toward spin alignment.
__label__positive In each panel of Figure 6, the model CDFs do not have the same steepness as the black points.
__label__positive However, the error bars onthe isin values and the 68% con ﬁdence interval CDFs emphasize the low statistical signi ﬁcance of these discrepan- cies.
__label__positive It is possible that the measurements in this work do notstrictly follow a normal or log normal uncertainty distribution, explaining residual disagreement between model and data.
__label__positive Pleiades Inclinations The marginalized model parameters corresponding to the Pleiades inclination distributio n are consistent with both isotropy and aligned spins to a moderate degree, similar to NGC 2516 in Paper I.
__label__positive Isotropic or moderately a ligned spins in the Pleiades would be consistent with the res ults reported for GK stars by Jackson & Jeffries (2010,J10 ).W ec r o s sm a t c h e dt h e J10sample with Gaia DR2, resulting in 34 stars with 7 overlapping targetsbetween J10and our sample.
__label__positive 5The mean discrepancy between our isinvalues and those of J10is∼11%, comparable to the mean uncertainty of our inclinations.
__label__positive The greatest discrepancyis∼36%, which appears to come from a discrepancy in visin near our threshold of 5 km s−1.
__label__positive In addition to the possibility that the uncertainties in Pleiades visin measurements are not log normally distributed (discussed in Section 5.1 ), residualTable 3 Relevant Quantities and Determinations of Pleiades, Praesepe, and M35 Inclinations GDR2 Source ID R.A.

__label__positive discrepancies between the model and data CDFs may be caused by systematic offsets in one or more of the values listed inEquation (1)that propagate to the ﬁnal isin values.
__label__positive Radius inﬂation, in which stellar radii are larger than predicted by isochrones, is one possible source of systematic error in isin.
__label__positive Multiple studies have presented evidence for radius in ﬂation speciﬁcally within the Pleiades.
__label__positive (2017 )determined better than 10% agreement between measured and predicted radii of Pleiades stars with massesb e t w e e n0 .
__label__positive 2 M e, but found deviations at 95% con ﬁdence for stars in the 0.6 –0.8Merange.
__label__positive (2018 )found radii inﬂated by ∼15% for Pleiades stars between 0.1 and 0.8 Meand their results favor isotropic inclinations while ruling out values ofλ<30°.
__label__positive Somers & Stassun (2017,S17 )observed several instances of inﬂated radii for stars with T eff<5700 K, with minimal offsets f o rh o t t e rs t a r s (above 6000 K ).
__label__positive This latter result highlights the possibility that even some Pleiade s stars of G or later spectral type might have in ﬂated radii.
__label__positive We accessed the radius measurements of S17and compared them with the MIST isochrone corresponding to our input parameters for Pleiades SED ﬁtting.
__label__positive Depending on the color-to- effective-temperature conversion used in S17, we found that the mean fractional radius difference between the measured radii andthe isochrone ’sp r e d i c t i o ni s6 % –9% when selecting stars with Teff between 4900 and 5900 K, which approximately corresponds to t h ec o o l e rh a l fo fs t a r si no u r isinsample for the Pleiades.
__label__positive Between 70% and 80% of S17stars in this effective temperature range have radii greater than our isochrone ’s prediction.
__label__positive This discrepancy in radii for a large fraction of coole r stars suggests that our radius values determined from SED ﬁtting may be underestimated, thereby overestimating isin (see Equation (1)).
__label__positive The potential systematic effect of radius in ﬂation emphasizes the bene ﬁt of accurately quantifying radius systematics in the young clusters of our study.
__label__positive Applying a high-con ﬁdence correction to in ﬂated radius measurements could reduce or overcome this systematic error.
__label__positive Praesepe Inclinations Our analysis of the 35 isin values that we determined for Praesepe is most similar to the ﬁrst, isotropic test that we performed in Section 3.4.
__label__positive Analyzing a larger sample of 113 stars, Kovacs (2018,K18 )found that the most likely two- parameter model results for the Praesepe inclination distribu- tion were α=76°±14°andλ=47°±24°.
__label__positive These parameters are similar (by design )to those of the third and fourth validation runs of our MCMC method in Section 3.4.

__label__positive by these simulations, a moderately aligned scenario like the one reported by K18 is not statistically distinguishable from isotropy for both 30 and 120 star samples, even when includingstars with < visin 5 km s−1in the latter.
__label__positive The minimal dependence of the precision of the parameters on the sample size suggests that the difference in quantity of sin ivalues between this work and K18 is not the source of the discrepant results.
__label__positive Sources of the smaller number of isin values reported in this work compared with K18include our use of the cluster member list of Cantat-Gaudin et al.
__label__positive (2018 ), elimination of the binary main sequence, establishment of a RUWE cutoff to further cull binaries, use of a single K2 rotation period catalog (Rebull et al.
__label__positive 2017 ) versus the additional inclusion of ground-based measurements(Kovács et al.
__label__positive 2014 ), the exclusion of stars with < visin 5 km s−1 and removal of stars with spurious rotation periods and LOS velocities.
__label__positive In principle, having a larger sample of isinvalues can amplify the effect of systematic errors on the resulting CDF.
__label__positive We made the above selections to reduce the in ﬂuence of potential systematic error in our inclinatio n distribution.
__label__positive For example, weﬁnd evidence of systematics among the equal-mass binary sample in that∼33% of the K18 stars we classify as binaries using the cluster ’sC M Dh a v e >isin 1.75 , compared with ∼3% of the remaining 95 stars on the single-star main sequence.
__label__positive K18 ʼs removal of stars with >isin 2preferentially excludes many of these binaries, achieving a similar result to our explicit exclusion of CMD outliers.
__label__positive Figure 11plots our data in the left panel and those of K18at right.
__label__positive Both sets of isinvalues have a high probability of being drawn from the same distribution (two-sample K –S test p-value ∼0.9 ).
__label__positive The overall compatibility of the K18 distribution with this work ’s validates the K18 isin determinations.
__label__positive However, our work ’s determination of the spread half-angle and mean inclination for the cluster does not strongly prefer a moderatelyaligned scenario over the isotropic case.
__label__positive In each panel of Figure 11, the red curve represents an isotropic spin-axis distribution, while the maroon dashes represent the K18values forαandλ.
__label__positive The similarity of the two distributions underscores the degree of similarity between the two scenarios.

__label__positive byK18 remains, but the distribution is consistent with both isotropy and moderate alignment, much like our results for NGC 2516 in Paper Iand the Pleiades in this work.
__label__positive M35 Inclinations The M35 inclination distribution, with the largest sample size of the three clusters, is poorest ﬁt by the two-parameter model.
__label__positive The CDF corresponding to the peak of the marginalizedPPDs is offset from the majority of isin values, and the empirical distribution of stars with isin 0.75 visibly differs from that of the isotropic model, which otherwise shows closer agreement with points above this threshold than the PPD-peakmodel (Figure 6).
__label__positive The spatial positions and proper motions of the six lowest-inclination stars do not display statistically signiﬁcant incompatibilities with the null hypotheses of uniform position angles and consistency with the proper motions of higher-inclination stars.
__label__positive Nonetheless, we further discuss these stars to narrow down the possible explanationsfor their grouping.
__label__positive Possible Systematics It is important to consider potential sources of systematic errors to verify they are not the cause of the excess of low isinvalues.
__label__positive We note that among the visin,RandPvalues for M35, the distribution of measured visin is most discrepant with the predicted distribution for an is otropic scenario based on our simulations from Section 3.4 (two-sample K –Sp-value∼6× 10−5).
__label__positive This discrepancy is primarily manifest in a factor of ∼2 overdensity in measured versus predicted visin b e t w e e n1 0a n d 15 km s−1.
__label__positive The simulated RandPdistributions, constructed using the cluster ’s distribution of d e-reddened Gaia BP−RPcolor, are in closer agreement with their empirical counterparts (K–Sp- values∼0.01 and 0.25, respectively ).
__label__positive The WOCS study that sourced the visinmeasurements for this cluster used a solar spectrum t o cross correlate with each M35 spectrum.
__label__positive This could lead to systematic errors in visingiven the range of effective temperatures in the WOCS sample(∼4900–7500 K ).
__label__positive The solar macroturbulent velocity (v mac,e)is 3.21 km s−1(Doyle et al.
__label__positive For hotter (6000–6500 K )stars than the Sun, vmacis expected to be ∼4–6k ms−1respectively.
__label__positive When a star ’s projected rotational velocity is comparable to or less than vmac, the two sources of lin e broadening are dif ﬁcult to distinguish.
__label__positive Especially for hotter stars with larger vmac,t h i s degeneracy may lead to systematically increased WOCS visin values when macroturbulent broade ning is interpreted as rotationalFigure 7.
__label__positive We plot the isotropic distribution in red and the best- ﬁtting three-parameter model in blue.
__label__positive The latter model illustrates a scenario in which 10% of the cluster ’s stars are tightly aligned nearly along the line of sight, while the rest are isotropically oriented.
__label__positive Blue squares mark the starshaving <isin 0.35 , within the inclination range of the anisotropic subset of the three-parameter model.
__label__positive The stars with isin determinations are divided along =isin 0.35 , with the 61 stars above this threshold marked by orange circles and 6 below shown as blue diamonds.Figure 9.

__label__positive 11The Astrophysical Journal, 923:23 (17pp ), 2021 December 10 Healy, McCullough, & Schlaufman
__label__positive However, the 10 km s−1visin threshold for this study reduces this concern.
__label__positive For the cooler and younger than solar stars in the WOCS sample (∼4900–5700 )K, macroturbulent broadening is slightly smaller than in the Sun, but the level of magnetic activity is higher and may broaden spectral lines to a greater extent than for the Sun.
__label__positive For example, a comparison between Figure 3 of Schrijver et al.
__label__positive (2019 )shows that a sample of 737 mostly K–M dwarfs in the Pleiades had ﬂare frequencies nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the Sun.
__label__positive Withoutaccounting for the increased activity broadening in young, cool stars, broadening relative to a solar spectrum may be interpreted as rotational in origin during spectra l cross correlation, potentially leading to overestimating visin for the cooler M35 stars.
__label__positive This effect may explain why some stars appear above the contour of Figure 2, where by design we anticipate no stars should appear because of the 10 km s−1threshold applied to visinfor M35.
__label__positive Due to the similar young ages of M35 and the Pleiades, it is possible that radius in ﬂation exists among the cooler stars of both clusters.
__label__positive Since we are currently using radius values not corrected for possible in ﬂation, we are determining an upper limit for isinrather than a lower limit (see Equation (1)).
__label__positive Thus, in the case of the low isin values of interest in M35, it is unlikely that radius in ﬂation is the source of the discrepancy with isotropy.
__label__positive The effects described above would manifest in increased isin values above their actual inclination, but they do not explain a distribution that has an overdensity of lower inclinations.
__label__positive Aliased rotation periods can cause integer discrepancies in theresulting isin values, yielding signi ﬁcant systematics in both directions.
__label__positive However, we have already removed periods that are highly discrepant from empirical color –period isochrones, and we have visually inspected the light curves of each star to verify that the periods appear to be fundamentals, rather than harmonic.
__label__positive While we suspect that visinis systematically overestimated for the cooler stars of the sample, an opposing systematicwould have to be acting to decrease visin measurements for other stars, and it would have to be happening across the CMD —the six stars of the low-inclination subset range in Tefffrom ∼5000 to 7000 K, spanning both the slow- and fast –rotating sequences of the cluster.
__label__positive It remains possible that an unexplained systematic error in visinaffecting measurements near the 10 km s−1threshold is responsible for the excess of low-inclination values.5.6.
__label__positive Differential Rotation Differential rotation can lead to systematically longer period measurements when spots at nonzero latitudes are moving slower than their star ’s equatorial rotation velocity.
__label__positive The measurement of visincan also be underestimated due to this effect since a differentially rotating star will have less of its surface contributing to extreme line-of-sight velocities com- pared to a uniform rotator.
__label__positive (2014 )considered the combined effect that these biases can have on inclination determinations.
__label__positive The authors quanti ﬁed differential rotation using the equation () ( ) ( ) a W= W -ll 1s i n , 3eq2 where Ω(l)is the angular velocity at latitude l,Ωeqis the equatorial angular velocity, and αis the ratio of polar to equatorial angular velocities.
__label__positive By combining Equation (3)with an empirical relation between α,Ωeq, and a young star ’s effective temperature (Figure 1 of Collier Cameron 2007 ),i ti s possible to estimate the amount by which rotation periods aremeasured systematically longer.
__label__positive We calculate that for the starsof the Pleiades, Praesepe, and M35, αis approximately 0.1–0.2.
__label__positive Combined with the assumption that spots are typically situated at Sun-like latitudes of |l|∼20°±20°,w e ﬁnd that measured rotation periods could be overestimated by 1% –2% on average, and 4% –8% at l=40°.
__label__positive By simulating changes to a spectral line pro ﬁle, Hirano et al.
__label__positive (2014 )also approximated the effect of differential rotation on projected rotation velocity measurements.
__label__positive Their modelingestimated that the fraction fby which visinis underestimated isf∼1−α/2.
__label__positive For αbetween 0.1 and 0.2, this yields a 5% – 10% fractional underestimate of visin.
__label__positive In Equation (1),isin is proportional to both Pandvisin.
__label__positive Thus, an overestimated period and an underestimated rotation velocity will act in opposing directions to change thedetermined inclination.
__label__positive Using the quantitative estimates we have described above, we predict the underestimation of isin by a factor between 1% and 8% due to differential rotation.
__label__positive Since the typical random isinuncertainties for each cluster in this work dominate the potential systematic error in quadrature, differential rotation cannot signi ﬁcantly affect the results of our analysis.
__label__positive This effect is also not a satisfactory resolution to the excess of low-inclination stars in M35.Table 4 Mean Determinations of Pleiades, Praesepe, and M35 Internal Kinematics Cluster Direction θc(°) v0(km s−1) vrot(km s−1) σ(km s−1) Tangential L –0.018±0.022 L 0.597±0.016 Pleiades Radial L –0.106±0.024 L 0.673±0.018 LOS 270 ±40 5.72 ±0.10 0.25 ±0.15 0.73 ±0.10 Tangential L 0.132±0.027 L 0.611±0.019 Praesepe Radial L –0.027±0.036 L 0.811±0.025 LOS 300 ±100 35.000 ±0.097-+0.093.065.100.626±0.099 Tangential L 0.010±0.027 L 0.808±0.020 M35 Radial L –0.052±0.027 L 0.812±0.020 LOS 200 ±30 –8.041±0.060 0.186 ±0.088 0.848 ±0.045 Note.

__label__positive Physical Interpretations of M35 Grouping A possible physical interpretation of the low isingrouping is that the stars share similar inclinations because they inheritedangular momentum from a clump that formed within the largerprogenitor giant molecular cloud.
__label__positive de Grijs (2010, and references therein )describe the observations and theory that suggest a prevalence of clumps and other substructures inmolecular clouds that form clusters.
__label__positive Simulations such as thoseby Federrath & Klessen (2013 )ﬁnd that within a molecular cloud, stars form mostly in dense ﬁlaments.
__label__positive If such a ﬁlament or clump explains the low isingrouping in the 150 Myr old M35, it would be necessary to explain why thephases of the stars ’orbits did not get randomized after roughly8 crossing times (∼18 Myr for M35 ).
__label__positive If the stars are gravitationally bound and orbit the cluster center with the same period, they could avoid the aforementioned dispersal oftheir spatial grouping.
__label__positive However, while the relaxation time for M35, at t relax∼570 Myr, is greater than its age, cluster substructure is expected to be lost on a timescale of a fewMyr (e.g., Schmeja et al.
__label__positive This prediction contradicts the interpretation of the low- isinstars as a grouping related from their formation.
__label__positive It is also possible that these stars more recentlymerged with M35, having formed nearby but separately fromthe rest of the cluster.
__label__positive Conﬁdence in these stars ’physical association could be increased by determining the positions of each star along theLOS relative to cluster center.
__label__positive Top panels: binned tangential (blue )and radial (green )proper motions as a function of plane-of-sky distance to cluster center.
__label__positive Expected radial trends from LOS motion have been subtracted.
__label__positive Bottom panels: binned proper motion dispersions as a function of radial distance.
__label__positive We also plot LOS velocity dispersi ons for each cluster along with 68% con ﬁdence intervals in black.
__label__positive The number of stars analyzed for each cluster ’s tangential and radial kinematics is displayed as nTR, while nLOS indicates the number of LOS velocity measurements.

__label__positive the same side of the cluster, it would be more likely that they are physically associated.
__label__positive While EDR3 parallax measurementscannot provide this insight, a K –S test suggests that the distribution of LOS velocities of low isin stars is not signiﬁcantly different than that of high isin stars.
__label__positive Contrasted with the signi ﬁcant groupings of position angles and proper motions for low isinstars, the data do not offer a conclusive answer on their physical association.
__label__positive If the low-inclination stars are indeed physically associated, their alignment would be consistent with the results of multiple numerical simulations.
__label__positive (2017 )simulated a molecular cloud with radius 0.084 pc and mass 103Me forming a 140 Meproto-cluster.
__label__positive The simulations predict that if ∼50% of a molecular cloud ’s kinetic energy is in overall rotation, then the transfer of global angular momentum canresult in aligned spins for stars >0.7M e.
__label__positive Based on their effective temperatures and Table 5 of Pecaut & Mamajek (2013 ), all of the low isin stars in M35 have masses greater than this threshold.
__label__positive Below 0.7 Me, not enough material is accreted to overcome the randomizing effect of turbulence, which would contribute most of the remaining 50% of the cloud ’s kinetic energy.6This energy balance is similar to what was found to produce alignment on a larger spatial scale (resolution 0.1 pc )by the simulations of Rey-Raposo & Read (2018 ).
__label__positive These authors suggest that the mixed results from observational studies of spin alignment could all be consistent if the alignment is stronger in higher-mass clusters.
__label__positive While M35 is the most massive cluster of our sample, there is not yet alarge enough collection of cluster inclination distributions toﬁrmly establish a trend.
__label__positive Both of the above simulations neglected magnetic ﬁelds, which are known to have an important role in shapingmolecular clouds and moderating the star formation rate (Hennebelle & Inutsuka 2019, and references therein ).
__label__positive Oneset of magnetized cloud collapse simulations showed that ﬁlamentary structures were enhanced by a strong magnetic ﬁeld, and that these structures were roughly aligned with the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld lines (Price & Bate 2008 ).
__label__positive Stronger magnetic ﬁelds in these simulations also resulted in anisotropic turbulent motions, suggesting that even the mechanism expected to randomize stellar spins in clusters could have a reduced in ﬂuence in some cases.
__label__positive Cluster Kinematics Each cluster ’s radial proper motions include binned values that signiﬁcantly disagree with zero afte r accounting for the cluster ’s motion along the LOS (Figure 10).
__label__positive The greatest discrepancies with zero occur in the negative (radially inward )direction.
__label__positive The Pleiades show negative discrepancies at all radial distances from cluster center.
__label__positive For Praesepe and M35, the inward discrepancies are pronounced at larger radial distances.
__label__positive Based on the knownevolutionary stages of clusters, one might instead expect to observe net motion in a radially outward direction within a cluster ’sh a l o , owing to the plentiful lo w-mass stars that rise (or even escape )as a result of dynamical interactions with more massive stars (mass segregation ).
__label__positive It is possible that these discrepancies manifest in each cluster ’s mean proper motions due to the combined effects of escaped stars and the selection of members with a Gaia G magnitude <18 (Cantat-Gaudin et al.
__label__positive The processes of stellar ejection (due to a single close encounter )and, more commonly, evaporation (the sum of numerous weak encounters )cause a cluster to lose members over time (Gerhard 2000 ).
__label__positive The numerical simulations of Moyano Loyola & Hurley (2013 )modeled the dynamical evolution of clusters with initial masses ranging from ∼6000 to 9000 Me.
__label__positive At ages between 50 and 1000 Myr, these simulations predicted a single-star escape velocity of ∼2k ms−1.D eﬁning an escaped star as unbound and surpassing a 100 pc radial distance to cluster center, the simulations found that ∼20% of each model cluster ’s stars escaped within 100 Myr, increasing to∼40% by 600 Myr.
__label__positive In our work, we did not analyze stars at such large distances from their cluster ’s center.Figure 11.
__label__positive Comparison between this work ’sisindeterminations for Praesepe (left )and those of Kovacs (2018, right ).
__label__positive The empirical CDFs are likely to represent the same underlying distribution (K–Sp-value∼0.9 ).
__label__positive The red solid curves in each panel show a model isotropic distribution, while the maroon dashed curves were generated with the parameters reported in K18 (α=76°,λ=47°).
__label__positive At left, the model CDFs account for visinthreshold of 5 km s−1.
__label__positive 6This result cautions against the extrapolation of outcomes from, e.g., Jackson et al.
__label__positive (2018,2019 ), which suggested isotropic inclinations among low- mass stars in the Pleiades and Praesepe, to the more massive stars of theseclusters.
__label__positive 14The Astrophysical Journal, 923:23 (17pp ), 2021 December 10 Healy, McCullough, & Schlaufman
__label__positive For simulated clusters aged 1 Gyr, most of the escaped stars had mass <0.7Me.
__label__positive Given the ages of the Pleiades, Praesepe, and M35, between 20% and 40% of each cluster ’s initial stellar population may have escaped, leaving behind stars more massive than 0.7 Mebeing sent inward toward cluster center due to dynamical interactions with escaping stars.
__label__positive Byweighting the outlying radial velocities in Figure 10with a mean∼2k m s−1escape velocity for the predicted fraction of missing stars, we obtain signatures of net expansion, rather than contraction, in all radial bins.
__label__positive The membership magnitude threshold requiring G<18 may also bias the radial kinematics.
__label__positive We compute the absolute Gaiamagnitude M Gof the faintest possible star to be included in each cluster ’s list of members and use the results of Cifuentes et al.
__label__positive We ﬁnd that for the Pleiades and Praesepe, the G-magnitude threshold results in the exclusion of main-sequence stars later than M4.5 and M4, respectively.
__label__positive For the more distant M35 cluster, the spectral type cutoff is K8.
__label__positive According to Table 5 ofPecaut & Mamajek (2013 ), these spectral types correspond to masses of ∼0.18, 0.23, and 0.62 M e, respectively.
__label__positive Comparing our work ’s mass thresholds to the mass functions of Lodieu et al.
__label__positive (2019, Pleiades and Praesepe )and Barrado y Navascués et al.
__label__positive (2001, M35 )suggests that ∼30% of cluster members in the Pleiades and Praesepe (and∼60% in M35 ), all having masses ∼0.6Meor less, are excluded by the G- magnitude cutoff.
__label__positive Assuming that stellar escape is ongoing inthese clusters, we exclude these low-mass stars that make upthe escaping population.
__label__positive The remaining sample may be biasedtoward bound stars having inward-directed radial motion, reﬂecting the results of our analysis for each cluster.
__label__positive This potential bias cautions against interpreting the results ofFigure 10as representative of the entire cluster.
__label__positive While spectral type might be expected to predict radial motion in a cluster, there are no expectations for its correlation with net tangential motion, allowing for a less biaseddetermination of cluster rotation.
__label__positive We observe a signi ﬁcant signal of rotation in the plane of the sky only among the stars of Praesepe.
__label__positive The positive mean tangential proper motion corresponds to clockwise rotation.
__label__positive 7Even though the relaxation time of Praesepe, at ∼140 Myr, is much less than its age, the rotation signal is signi ﬁcantly nonzero at large distances from cluster center.
__label__positive It may be possible that relaxation has dissipated angular momentum closer to the center, but not in the outerreaches of the cluster.
__label__positive Another Gaia-based study, Loktin & Popov (2020 ), also found a plane-of-sky signature of rotation in Praesepe at large distances from cluster center with a speed of∼0.4 km s −1.
__label__positive This value is quite similar to the tangential speed of the most radially distant bin in our analysis, and both papers report the same direction of rotation.
__label__positive The other two clusters donot show signi ﬁcant signs of rotation in their proper motions.
__label__positive We also see a less signi ﬁcant rotation signal about an axis perpendicular to the LOS in M35.
__label__positive The younger M35 (age< t relax )is less likely to have experienced dissipation of its primordial angular momentum.
__label__positive Since we do not detectsigniﬁcant rotation in the plane of the sky for M35, the inclination of this cluster ’s rotation axis is likely closer to 90 ° (edge-on )than 0 °according to our convention.
__label__positive We make a simple estimate of the rotation axis orientation using the arctanof the ratio of LOS to plane-of-sky rotation, ﬁnding this angle to be∼87°.
__label__positive Therefore, M35 ʼs rotation axis is not likely to be consistent with the orientation of stars in the low isingrouping, which has a nearly pole-on mean inclination of 5 °.
__label__positive This comparison suggests that if the grouping of stars is indeed aphysical substructure in the cluster, its angular momentum isnot correlated with that of the cluster as a whole.
__label__positive A c c o r d i n gt oC a n t a t - G a u d i n&B r a n d t (2021 ), color-dependent proper motion systematics of ∼10μas yr −1remain after applying their correction to the Gaia EDR3 data.
__label__positive This level of residual systematics cannot expla in the statistically signi ﬁcant deviations from zero that we report.
__label__positive We note that for all clusters, the inferredrotation velocities are at least four times smaller than the velocity dispersion in each dimension.
__label__positive Thus, each cluster is dominated by dispersion rather than ordered rotation.
__label__positive Conclusions and Future Work We extended the study of stellar spin-axis orientations that we began with NGC 2516 (Paper I)to three additional open clusters: Pleiades, Praesepe, and M35.
__label__positive Studying many clusters in a systematic way can reveal interesting trends and outliersthat offer insight beyond individual clusters.
__label__positive In the Pleiades and Praesepe, we found inclination distribu- tions consistent with both isotropy and moderate alignment.Our result for the Pleiades agrees with a previous study byJackson & Jeffries (2010 ).
__label__positive We did not ﬁnd evidence of overall cluster rotation in the Pleiades.
__label__positive We compared our Praesepe results to those of Kovacs (2018 ), who reported moderate spin alignment in the cluster.
__label__positive We found that both studies ’inclination distributions closely overlap, but our analysis of the distribution does n ot prefer alignment over isotropy.
__label__positive While our analysis does not rule out moderately aligned scenarios, its results are consistent with si mulations that modeled isotropic spins.
__label__positive We also observed a signi ﬁcant signature of this cluster ’s overall rotation in the plane of the sky.
__label__positive The addition of more inclination distributions consistent with both isotropy and moderate alignment to our sample of clustersbegins to provide a path toward breaking the degeneracyassociated with each one.
__label__positive Assuming that the direction and degree of spin alignment is not correlated across multiple clusters, it is more probable that a collection of inclinationdistributions with degenerate parameters represents isotropi- cally oriented spins instead of similar moderate alignment and mean inclinations for all clusters in the sample.
__label__positive Our plannedstudy of ∼10 more clusters may help us to infer isotropic spins for a larger collection of inclinations which, on their own, do not offer such conclusive results.
__label__positive Our largest sample of inclination determinations in M35 was overall best ﬁt by a moderately aligned model, while the isotropic model shows closer agreement with more points in the CDF.
__label__positive However, within the distribution of M35 isinvalues, we identi ﬁed an overdensity of stars preferentially inclined close to the LOS, six of which showed visual (but statistically insigni ﬁcant )clustering of proper motions and position angles.
__label__positive We did not identify a systematic effect that could result in this grouping of inclinations, but among the measurements in Equation (1)used to determine isin, thevisindistribution was most discrepant with isotropic predictions.
__label__positive It is possible than an unexplained systematic error in visin values near the measurement threshold is the source of this discrepancy.
__label__positive Wealso explored the physical interpretation that the grouping iscomposed of associated stars that inherited common angular 7Since this paper ’s coordinate system de ﬁnes the eastward direction as positive, the rotation direction inferred from the sign of tangential motion is opposite the convention of Kamann et al.

__label__positive momentum at the time of their formation in a clump with a roughly equal balance of rotational and turbulent kinetic energy, aided by organized magnetic ﬁelds.
__label__positive At an age of ∼150 Myr, however, M35 is too old to be expected to display this kind of grouping.
__label__positive We offer the following ways to further improve future studies: the sample sizes of clusters and member stars could beincreased with multi-object spectroscopic observations todetermine visinfor additional cluster members.
__label__positive The upcoming PLATO mission, with ∼30% better angular resolution and ∼30×longer dwell time compared with TESS, will yield precise photometry of stars in more distant and older clusters.While the spectro-photometric method is not favorable forolder clusters, PLATO will facilitate new asteroseismic studies of stellar spin through its long-baseline observations, especially for evolved stars.
__label__positive Models of radius in ﬂation in young stars could improve the accuracy of subsequent isin determinations or assist in culling particular stars from the sample .
__label__positive Additional numer ical simulations of molecular cloud collapse and cl uster evolution could further address the possibility of aligned spins, including whetheralignment might manifest and persist in a subgroup of clusterstars.
__label__positive Finally, asteroseismic det erminations of stellar inclinations can be less susceptible to the sys tematic errors inherent to the spectro-photometric method, but reliable measurements requirecontinuous, multi-ye ar photometry at high precision.
__label__positive We will continue our systematic, spectro-photometric open cluster spin study in upcoming work, using publicly available spectro-photometric data to determine th e inclination distributions of stars in ∼10 more clusters and synthesizing all of our results.

__label__positive California Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91125, USA14Benoziyo Center for Astrophysics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel Received 2019 March 11; revised 2019 May 16; accepted 2019 May 26; published 2019 July 15 Abstract We report the discovery of nonstellar hydrogen Balmer and metastable helium absorption lines accompanying a transient, high-velocity (0.05c)broad absorption line (BAL )system in the optical spectra of the tidal disruption event (TDE )AT2018zr (z=0.071 ).
__label__positive In the Hubble Space Telescope UV spectra, absorption of high- and low- ionization lines is also present at this velocity, making AT2018zr resemble a low-ionization BALQSO.
__label__positive Weconclude that these transient absorption features are more likely to arise in fast out ﬂows produced by the TDE than absorbed by the unbound debris.
__label__positive In accordance with the out ﬂow picture, we are able to reproduce the ﬂat-topped Hαemission in a spherically expanding medium without invoking the typical prescription of an elliptical disk.
__label__positive We also report the appearance of narrow (∼1000 kms−1)NIIIλ4640, He IIλ4686, H α, and H βemission in the late- time optical spectra of AT2018zr, which may be a result of UV continuum hardening at late times, as observed by Swift.
__label__positive Including AT2018zr, we ﬁnd a high association rate (three out of four )of BALs in the UV spectra of TDEs.
__label__positive This suggests that out ﬂows may be ubiquitous among TDEs and less sensitive to viewing angle effects compared to QSO out ﬂows.
__label__positive Key words: accretion, accretion disks –black hole physics –galaxies: nuclei –ultraviolet: general 1.
__label__positive Introduction Occasionally, a star passing too close to a black hole may be disrupted by tidal stresses.
__label__positive This results in an observabletransient ﬂare of radiation powered by the accretion of about half of the stellar debris onto the black hole (Rees 1988 ; Phinney 1989 ).
__label__positive A signi ﬁcant amount of theoretical work has been devoted to predicting the rate at which the stellar debris falls back to the pericenter.
__label__positive For black holes with M BH 107Me, the fallback rate —and the accretion rate, if circular- ization is ef ﬁcient—may exceed the Eddington rate at early times (Evans & Kochanek 1989 ; Ulmer 1999 ; Strubbe & Quataert 2009 ; Lodato & Rossi 2011 ; Metzger & Stone 2016 ; Wu et al.
__label__positive 2018 ), leading to the formation of radiation-powered winds or jets.
__label__positive Observations across all wavelengths have revealed that outﬂows may be ubiquitous among tidal disruption events (TDEs ).
__label__positive In the well-studied TDE ASASSN-14li, highly ionized outﬂows have been detected at both low (a few ×100 km s−1; Miller et al.
__label__positive Radio observations of ASASSN-14li alsorevealed the presence of a subrelativistic out ﬂow (Alexander et al.
__label__positive 2016 )or an off-axis relativistic jet (van Velzen et al.
__label__positive Spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing the kinematics and physical conditions in TDEs.
__label__positive Especially in the far-UV(FUV ), spectroscopy can shed light on the ionization structures owing to the wealth of atomic transitions encompassed in thiswavelength range.
__label__positive For the three TDEs that were observed with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS )on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST ), blueshifted absorption lines at FUV wavelengths that signify the presence of out ﬂows were detected in all three sources, namely, ASASSN-14li,iPTF16fnl, and iPTF15af (Cenko et al.
__label__positive These absorption lines are thought to be “intrinsic, ”meaning that the absorbing gas is physically close to the TDE.
__label__positive In particular, the broad, saturatedabsorption troughs of high-ionization transitions in iPTF15afare reminiscent of those seen in broad absorption line (BAL ) QSOs.
__label__positive (2019 )concluded that these features could only form in absorbers with high column densities N H>1023cm−2.The Astrophysical Journal, 879:119 (17pp ), 2019 July 10 https://doi.org /10.3847 /1538-4357 /ab24de © 2019.
__label__positive Although the current sample of UV spectroscopy of TDEs is small, a few spectroscopic distinctions between TDEs and QSOs have emerged in the past few years.
__label__positive For example,common quasar emission lines such as Mg IIλλ2796, 2803 and CIII]λ1909 are either weak or entirely missing in TDE spectra.
__label__positive The absence of Mg IIλλ2796, 2803 may be explained if these TDEs have a hotter continuum that has photoionized most Mgto higher ionization states (Cenko et al.
__label__positive On the other hand, the prominent N III]λ1750 relative to CIII]λ1909 in TDEs may imply abundance anomalies due to the CNO cycle in the predisrupted star (Cenko et al.
__label__positive Simulations have shown that the anomalous abundance features should be present after the time of peakfallback rate (t peak )and are more signi ﬁcant in higher-mass stars (Kochanek 2016 ; Yang et al.
__label__positive Observationally, TDEs have been discovered at a rate of one to two per year.
__label__positive We expect to see an order-of-magnitudeincrease in the TDE discovery rate from the combined yield ofground-based optical surveys since the beginning of 2018 (e.g., Hung et al.
__label__positive In light of this opportunity, we have started a monitoring campaign to obtain a series of UV spectra of newlydiscovered TDEs with HST.
__label__positive The ﬁrst target of this campaign (Program ID 15331; PI: Cenko )is AT2018zr (aka PS18kh ).I n this paper, we present the analysis of the intensive spectro- scopic observations of the TDE AT2018zr spanning across the UV and optical wavelengths in the ﬁrst 3 months since discovery, plus two late-time (Δt=169 and 248 days )optical spectra.
__label__positive While inspecting the data, we discovered a high-velocity (∼0.05c)BAL system that is accompanied by nonstellar hydrogen Balmer and metastable helium absorption, the ﬁrst time this has been observed in a TDE.
__label__positive The high signal-to-noiseratio (S/N)optical spectra enabled us to propose that a spherically expanding out ﬂow is preferred over the elliptical disk model (Holoien et al.
__label__positive 2018 )for generating the observed ﬂat-topped H αline.
__label__positive We summarize the discovery and photometric observations of AT2018zr in Section 2, detail the observation con ﬁgurations and data reduction for the UV and optical spectra in this work inSection 3, describe our analysis of the emission and absorption features identi ﬁed in the data in Section 4, and compare these observations with other TDEs and discuss the results inSection 5.
__label__positive Discovery of AT2018zr The TDE AT2018zr (aka PS18kh )wasﬁrst discovered by Pan-STARRS1 on UT 2018 March 2 (Holoien et al.
__label__positive The ﬂare is coincident (offset01)with the galaxy SDSS J075654.53 +341543.6 at a redshift of z=0.071 (Section 3.2 ).
__label__positive Archival observations of this galaxy suggest that it is dominated by an old stellar population(t age=9.8 Gyr )with a stellar mass of 5 ×109Me(van Velzen et al.
__label__positive The lack of X-ray emission prior to the TDE ﬂare suggests little or no active galactic nucleus (AGN )activity (Holoien et al.
__label__positive A black hole mass of ≈107Meis inferred from the host photometry (Holoien et al.
__label__positive While the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Bellm et al.
__label__positive 2019 )was still in the commissioning phase, the survey serendipitously observed thisobject from 2018 February 7.
__label__positive A complete set of ZTF light curves of this source can be found in van Velzen et al.
__label__positive (2019 )analyzed the broadband multiwavelength (UV/optical /X-ray/radio ) properties of AT2018zr.
__label__positive Before the object was Sun-con-strained, they found that the UV and optical emission of thissource corresponds to a constant blackbody temperature of »´T 1.4 104K in the ﬁrst 40 days, then increases to T≈2.2 ×104K (Holoien et al.
__label__positive A weak, thermal (kT∼100 eV )X-ray source 2 orders of magnitude less luminous than the UV was detected (van Velzen et al.
__label__positive The late-time (Δt170 days )UV/optical photometric observations show a signi ﬁcant increase in the blackbody temperature (T5×104K), while the X-ray ﬂux remains almost the same (van Velzen et al.
__label__positive (2019 )focused on the broadband optical –to–X-ray behavior of AT2018zr, Holoien et al.
__label__positive (2018 ) included analysis of the optical spectra of AT2018zr.
__label__positive Theirobservations were made in the ﬁrst 3 months of discovery before the target became Sun-constrained.
__label__positive Their analysis used a combination of wind, elliptical disk, and spiral arm to ﬁt the Hαline pro ﬁle and inferred a large size for the accretion disk (r in∼500rgandrout∼15,000 rg).
__label__positive In this work, we present the ﬁrst analysis of the multi-epoch HST UV spectra of AT2018zr in conjunction with optical spectroscopic observations obtained independently in the time frame of the observations in Holoien et al.
__label__positive Although our optical spectroscopic data set is similar to that in Holoienet al.
__label__positive (2018 ), we use a different model to interpret the emission line shape (Section 4.3.2 )for the data obtained in the same time period.
__label__positive Furthermore, our optical spectroscopic observationsextend to later epochs (Δt170 days )to study the late-time spectroscopic evolution of this TDE, which have not been reported before.
__label__positive Observations After it was con ﬁrmed that AT2018zr was bright in the UV from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift; Gehrels et al.
__label__positive 2004 )observations, we triggered a series of spectroscopic follow-up observations with HST STIS, as well as other ground-based optical telescopes.
__label__positive No observations were madewhen the target went behind the Sun from 2018 June to August.
__label__positive We resumed following up this source when it became visible again in 2018 September.
__label__positive All the spectra presented inthis paper have been corrected for galactic extinction using the Schla ﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011 )dust map.
__label__positive (1989 )extinction curve, using R C=3.1 and E(B−V)= 0.0404 ±0.0006 at this position corresponds to a Galactic visual extinction of AV=0.124 mag.
__label__positive No correction has been made for any internal extinction.
__label__positive Throughout this paper, weadopt a ﬂatΛCDM cosmology with H 0=69.3 km s−1Mpc−1, Ωm=0.29, and ΩΛ=0.71 (Bennett et al.
__label__positive The time difference (Δt)is expressed in rest-frame time with respect to ther-band maximum at MJD 58,194.49.
__label__positive 3.1.HST STIS Spectra We obtained ﬁve epochs of UV spectra of AT2018zr with HST STIS (GO 15331; PI: Cenko )on 2018 April 11 (Δt= 23 days ),2 5 (Δt=36 days ), and 30 (Dt=41 days )and May 20 (Δt=59 days )and 23 (Δt=62 days ).
__label__positive The spectra were obtained through a 52 ″×02 aperture.
__label__positive For the near-UV 2The Astrophysical Journal, 879:119 (17pp ), 2019 July 10 Hung et al.
__label__positive (NUV )and FUV MAMA detectors, the G140L and G230L gratings were used in order to cover the spectral ranges of 1570–3180 and 1150 –1730 Åat resolutions of 1.2 and 3.2 Å, respectively.
__label__positive During each visit, the observation was obtained over three HST orbits, with three equal exposures of 674 s in the NUV and six equal exposures of 920 s in the FUV.
__label__positive Wecombined the one-dimensional spectra for each epoch usinginverse-variance weighting.
__label__positive The HST spectra of AT2018zr have similar S /Ns to previous HST spectra for TDEs.
__label__positive For the FUV side of the spectrum, the S /Ni s∼6, while the S /Ni s∼9 for the NUV side.
__label__positive Optical Spectra We obtained 15 optical spectra of AT2018zr in total.
__label__positive The observing con ﬁguration for each spectrum is detailed in Table 1.
__label__positive The data obtained with the spectral energy distribution machine (SEDm ), an integral ﬁeld unit spectrograph, were automatically processed by the data reduction pipeline andﬂux-calibrated with the observations of spectrophotometric standard stars (Blagorodnova et al.
__label__positive Spectra obtained with the Auxiliary-port CAMera (ACAM ) on the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope (WHT ), the DeVeny spectrograph on the Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT ), the Double Beam Spectrograph on the Palomar 200 inch (P200 ) telescope, and with Gemini /GMOS-N were reduced with standard IRAF routines.
__label__positive We performed bias subtraction and ﬂat-ﬁelding in the raw science frames and extracted the one- dimensional spectrum.
__label__positive Afterward, we performed wavelengthandﬂux calibration using observations of the arc lamp and ﬂux standard stars from the same night.
__label__positive Data obtained with the Keck Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS; Oke et al.
__label__positive 1995 )were reduced with the LRIS automated reduction pipeline.
__label__positive 15 We measured a redshift of z=0.071 ±0.001 using CaH+Kλλ3969, 3934 and the near-infrared Ca II triplet (8498, 8542, and 8662 Å)absorption lines that originated from the host galaxy from the late-time Keck spectrum obtained inDecember 2018.
__label__positive Our redshift measurement is consistent withthe value (z=0.074 )estimated by Holoien et al.
__label__positive Analysis The interpretation of the UV and optical spectra is complicated by the presence of a high-velocity transient BAL system at v≈1.55 ×104km s−1(Section 4.1 ).
__label__positive This BAL system manifests in UV and optical absorption troughs on top of the TDE continuum or, sometimes, the emission lines.
__label__positive The rest-frame optical BALs such as the hydrogen Balmer seriesand the metastable helium lines are particularly rare even in BALQSOs.
__label__positive In the following subsections, we carefully account for these absorption features while identifying and measuringthe UV and optical emission lines.
__label__positive Absorption Lines We identi ﬁed highly blueshifted hydrogen Balmer series, He I*λ3889, and He I*λ5876 transitions in the Keck optical spectrum from Δt=50 days.
__label__positive These features can be easily seen when the spectrum is normalized with respect to the continuum,as shown in Figure 1.
__label__positive We modeled these lines with a single Gaussian and present the equivalent width (EW )and FWHM measurements for the hydrogen and helium absorption lines inTable 2.
__label__positive Because the H Balmer and He Iabsorption lines are often accompanied by contamination from nearby features, the deﬁnition of the local continuum is more uncertain.
__label__positive For example, the EW measured for the H αabsorption should be viewed as a lower limit, since the blueshifted H αabsorption is close to the broad blue wing of the H αemission.
__label__positive Given that the blueshifted Hγabsorption may be susceptible to H δemissions in the TDE rest frame, the measured EW should also be considered as a l o w e rl i m i t .W em e a s u r e da nF W H Mo f2 7 2 0 ±200 km s−1for Hβabsorption, which is the strongest blueshifted optical absorption line that is free from contamination.
__label__positive From these lines, we derived a mean velocity of (15,500 ±400 )km s−1by employing the relativistic Doppler equation.
__label__positive Absorptions at thisvelocity also match with the troughs seen in the HST STIS spectra in both high (N Vλ1240, Si IVλ1397, N IV]λ1486, CIVλ1549, N III]λ1750, C III]λ1909, and Al IIIλ1857 )and low (SiIIλ1265, C IIλ1335, [OI]λ1304, and Mg IIλλ2796, 2803 )ionization lines in the last two epochs (days 59 and 62 ).Table 1 Observing Details of the Optical Spectra of AT2018zr Obs.

__label__positive We stacked the two HST spectra, as there is little spectroscopic evolution during this time, and we give a list of detected UV absorption lines in Table 3.
__label__positive We also include measurements of the absorption central wavelength and the width in the TDE restframe, where possible.
__label__positive The relative line intensities of multiple hydrogen Balmer transitions are often used to constrain neutral hydrogen columndensity.

__label__positive (Tlis nonnegligible ), the EW of the line will be altered by a factor of (1−Bλ(Tl)/Ic).
__label__positive This effect on the observed line EW is degenerate with that of the covering factor.

__label__positive The optical depth ratio can be derived under the assumption that the absorbing gas is in local thermodynamicequilibrium.

__label__positive It is clear from the line ratios that the H Balmer absorption lines are quite saturated.
__label__positive If the H Balmer absorptions were optically thin, the EW ratio for the H Balmer series would beclose to τ Hα:τHβ:τHγ:τHδ:τHò≈81.5: 11.2: 3.8: 1.8: 1.
__label__positive How- ever, as shown in Table 2, the observed EWs of all of the HBalmer lines are very similar, suggesting that these lines are largely suppressed due to nonnegligible optical depth.
__label__positive From the normalized spectrum, we also noticed that the absorptions are nonblack, meaning they do not extend down tozero.
__label__positive This is a clear sign of partial covering, where theabsorbing material does not cover the photoionizing continuum entirely.
__label__positive Weﬁrst model the observed Balmer absorption lines with Equation (2)by locking the relative opacity for each transition and assuming a constant covering factor (C 0)across all hydrogen line pro ﬁles.
__label__positive The best- ﬁt parameters from directly ﬁtting the observed spectrum are C0=0.2 and τ0,Hβ=1.5.
__label__positive We convert this to an H I(n=2)column density of 1.5 ×1015cm−2with Equation (2).
__label__positive However, the optical depth, and therefore the H I(n=2)column density derived from direct ﬁtting, may underestimate the actual values.
__label__positive The opacity is strongly suppressed by the ﬁtting routine, since the model absorption line shape becomes ﬂat-topped as it saturates, while the observed absorption features are more peak-like.
__label__positive One possibility is that each absorption trough is comprised of multiple unresolved narrow components with different velo-cities and covering factors.
__label__positive Rather than ﬁtting the line pro ﬁle, we instead use the curve- of-growth method to model the total opacity summed over the H Balmer transitions.
__label__positive We exclude the use of H αand H γin the ﬁt due to uncertain contributions from nearby emission lines.
__label__positive Shown in Figure 2, our best- ﬁt Gaussian parameter (b), ionic column density (N), and covering factor are b=313 ± 170 km s−1, log 10NHI(n=2)=17.6 ±0.9 cm−2, and log 10C= −0.6 ±0.2, respectively.
__label__positive The high opacity of the Balmer lines places the data points on the logarithmic regime of the curve, where the EW (Wλ)is relatively insensitive to N (µlW bN bln() ).
__label__positive The large uncertainty in bmay be attributed to the fact that this parameter is degenerate with the covering factor.
__label__positive However, the absorber needs to cover atleast 15% of the continuum as measured from H β.
__label__positive Therefore, b must be narrower than ∼500 km s−1, which translates to an FWHM of ∼900 km s−1.
__label__positive Considering these effects, the true NHI(n=2)should be even higher, placing a lower limit for τHβ720.

__label__positive bCannot be determined due to blending with neighboring lines.
__label__positive 5The Astrophysical Journal, 879:119 (17pp ), 2019 July 10 Hung et al.
__label__positive Traditionally, observers found the UV and optical photometry measured by Swift in TDEs in agreement with a bla ckbody spectrum with ~´T few 104K (e.g., Holoien et al.
__label__positive 2017 ).H o w e v e r ,t h i s agreement has not been carefully examined blueward of the Swift UVW 2b a n d (central wavelength 1928 Å).
__label__positive In fact, previous work has also suggested that a signi ﬁcant amount of TDE radiation may be emitted in the extreme UV (e.g., Dai et al.
__label__positive Therefore, while the blackbody spectrum captures the general shape of the NUV spectra in all ﬁve epochs, the FUV continuum cannot be determined as accurately.
__label__positive We also note that this blackbody spectrum cannot account for the X-ray ﬂux that was observed in AT2018zr.
__label__positive A second blackbody of T∼100 eV is required to describe the entire SED (v a nV e l z e ne ta l .
__label__positive The UV spectra of AT2018zr show complex features, where broad emission and absorption are variable and often blended together, making it dif ﬁcult to measure these lines accurately.
__label__positive In particular, the high-velocity BAL features (Section 4.1 )only become discernible in the UV spectra in later epochs.
__label__positive Despite the uncertainties in FUV continuum placement, we study the evolution of the FUV lines by assuming the underlying continuum is a single blackbody, with temperatures extrapolated from NUV and optical observations.
__label__positive Here we summarize the observed properties of these features qualitatively.
__label__positive The Ly αemission line is blueshifted by about 3000 km s−1in all ﬁve epochs.
__label__positive Assuming no additional source of FUV continuum ﬂux, the Ly αline ﬂux becomes ∼50% more prominent after Δt≈59 days.
__label__positive High-ionization N Vλ1240 emission may be present but is blended with the red wing of the broad Ly α; therefore, the NVλ1240 emission peak cannot be individually resolved.
__label__positive The high-ionization emission line Si IVλ1397 is also blueshifted by ∼3000 km s−1with respect to the rest frame of the host similar to the Ly αemission.
__label__positive In the ﬁrst two epochs, there is a marginally detected broad feature (FWHM ∼1.3 ×104km s−1)at the rest wavelength of Mg IIλλ2796, 2803.5.
__label__positive The likely presence of N Vλ1240 emission and the absence of the C IVλ1549 emission line in AT2018zr may be associated with the enhanced nitrogen-to-carbon (N/C)ratio (see (NV/CIV)0.1 for QSOs; Vanden Berk et al.
__label__positive 2001 )reported in previous TDEs ASASSN- 14li, iPTF16fnl, and iPTF15af (Cenko et al.
__label__positive 2018 ).W ed o not detect N IV]λ1486 or N III]λ1750 emission as in previous TDEs.
__label__positive None of the emission peaks shifted signi ﬁcantly over the monitoring period, which suggests that the kinematics of the UV line-emitting region did not vary much in the ﬁrst 2 months.
__label__positive The absorption features at v∼15,500 km s−1are weak or completely absent in the ﬁrst three epochs.
__label__positive In the last two epochs, absorption lines including high-ionization lines NVλ1240, Si IVλ1397, and C IVλ1549 and low- ionization lines [OI]λ1304, C IIλ1335, Si IIλ1265, CIIIλ977, Al IIIλ1857, and Mg IIλλ2796, 2803 are detected in the spectra.
__label__positive The UV absorption features detected in AT2018zr are consistent with those seen in low-ionization BAL (LoBAL )QSOs.
__label__positive The UV BALs are saturated and nonblack, suggesting partial covering of the continuum source.
__label__positive In the later two epochs, the UV absorptions are also seen to be shallowerthan the emission lines (e.g., Ly α), which indicates that the BAL system does not cover the line-emitting region entirely, either.
__label__positive Optical Spectroscopy At optical wavelengths, the host galaxy contributes a nonnegligible amount of ﬂux to the observed spectrum.
__label__positive Since there was no pre- ﬂare spectrum of the host galaxy, we estimated the host ﬂux in our spectroscopic aperture by ﬁtting a synthetic galaxy spectrum with SDSS model magnitudes (van Velzen et al.
__label__positive To perform subtraction of the host ﬂux, we ﬁrst calibrated the ﬂux level in each optical spectrum against Swift V -band photometry, interpolated to the spectroscopic epochs.
__label__positive We then convolved the synthetic host galaxy spectrum with a Gaussian kernel to account for instrumental broadeningand subtracted the broadened, synthetic spectrum from our observed spectra.
__label__positive We show the broadened model spectrum along with the late-time Keck spectrum in Figure 4to demonstrate the difference between the model and the data.
__label__positive The Keck spectrum is a superposition of the TDE continuum and lines and the host galaxy spectrum.
__label__positive While it is harder toassess the validity of the model with H αand H βgiven the complicated structure of the emission lines from the TDE, other stellar absorption lines (such as the Ca II)that are free from TDE line emission match the model pretty well.
__label__positive We note that itis not possible to reconstruct all of the narrow absorption lines accurately by ﬁtting stellar population synthesis models to broadband photometry of the host.
__label__positive In addition, any mismatch inthe resolution between the data and model can also lead to over-/undersubtraction around the absorption line regions.
__label__positive We note that TDEs are dominated by low-mass black holes(Wevers et al.
__label__positive 2017 )whose host galaxies have velocity dispersion (100 km s −1)that cannot be resolved in the low- resolution (R<3000 )spectra.
__label__positive Therefore, one should be aware that any narrow features with a width similar to theinstrumental resolution appearing at the wavelengths typicalFigure 2.
__label__positive Curve-of-growth analysis of the Balmer absorption lines.

__label__positive We also plot our data with log 10N=16.6 cm−2(green ) and log 10N=18.6 cm−2(pink )on the growth curve.
__label__positive In this high-opacity regime (τ>1), the EW is insensitive to N.

__label__positive of stellar absorption lines could be from the host and leave imprints on the host-subtracted spectrum.
__label__positive Such effects can beseen in the H βline in Figure 6, which can sometimes be misidenti ﬁed as a double-peaked feature.
__label__positive A montage of the host-subtracted spectra is shown in Figure 5.
__label__positive Theﬂuxes are normalized to the 5500 –6000 Åregion in rest wavelength and offset from each other for better visualization.
__label__positive We use the host-subtracted, Galactic extinction –corrected opticalspectra in all of our analyses.
__label__positive The same host galaxy model is assumed throughout this work (Figure 4).
__label__positive We describe our modeling of the optical emission lines before and after the Sun-constrained break separately, becausethe line pro ﬁles were dramatically different after the break.

__label__positive We offset the model by a constant in the insets for ease of comparison.
__label__positive Uncertainties in the host model or mismatched Gaussian kernel may cause over- /undersubtraction around the stellar absorption features.
__label__positive Such effects may leave the broad features in the ﬁnal host-subtracted spectrum looking like a double-peaked pro ﬁle.
__label__positive 7The Astrophysical Journal, 879:119 (17pp ), 2019 July 10 Hung et al.
__label__positive of spectra with good S /N, we noticed that the H αand Hβemission pro ﬁles were asymmetric, with what appeared to be a“dent”in the red wing (Figure 1).
__label__positive Although the positions of these “dents ”are consistent with He Iλ7065 and Fe IIλ5235 blueshifted by the same velocity as the BAL system, the widthand depth are broader and stronger than the other optical absorption lines.
__label__positive Given the similarity in the line pro ﬁle shapes of Hαand H β(Figures 6and8), this asymmetry is more likely the result of emission line region geometry than contaminationfrom neighboring absorption lines.Interestingly, the ﬂat-topped H Balmer emission pro ﬁles in AT2018zr in the earlier monitoring period differ from theGaussian emission lines seen in other TDEs.
__label__positive (2018 )toﬁt these lines with a model that combines the effects of an elliptical disk, spiral arm, and wind.Here we use two different approaches to model the observed lines, including (1)phenomenological ﬁtting with two Gaussians and (2)a radiative transfer equation in a spherical outﬂow.
__label__positive Double Gaussian Model In our initial attempt to ﬁt these lines, we noticed that the line proﬁles, especially H α, cannot be well described by a single Gaussian (green solid line in Figure 6).
__label__positive Therefore, we chose to ﬁt each ﬂat-topped Balmer line with two Gaussians simulta- neously.
__label__positive The choice of model was not motivated by the underlying physics of line formation but rather to obtain asatisfactory description of the line pro ﬁles.
__label__positive This allows us to measure the FWHM and line luminosity for comparison with other TDEs.
__label__positive Weﬁrst measured the continuum level in the spectral lines by performing a quadratic ﬁt to the region enclosing the lines (4630–5150 Åfor H βand 5950 –6950 Åfor H α).
__label__positive Although we have subtracted the synthetic galaxy from ourobserved spectra prior to measuring the lines, we ﬁnd theFigure 5.

__label__positive The original data are plotted in pale gray under the smoothed spectra.
__label__positive All spectra shown here have been binned in wavelength by 3, except for the Keck spectrum on day 31, which is binned by 5 pixels due to higher noise.

__label__positive It is clear from the plot that the ﬂat-topped pro ﬁle cannot be ﬁtted well by a single Gaussian.

__label__positive Therefore, wemasked the line centers while ﬁtting the emission lines.
__label__positive In the two-component ﬁt, we allowed the line centers, line widths, and amplitudes to vary freely and derived the best- ﬁt model by performing χ 2minimization.
__label__positive The two best- ﬁt Gaussians naturally center blueward and redward of the rest wavelengthof the line to produce the ﬂat-topped shape.
__label__positive The best- ﬁt two-component model is marked in purple in Figure 6.
__label__positive From the best- ﬁt models, we measured the luminosity, EW, and FWHM for both H αand H βlines.
__label__positive Spherical Out ﬂow Model for Emission Lines Roth & Kasen (2018 )demonstrated that in TDE out ﬂows, the blue absorption wing of a classical P Cygni pro ﬁle may appear mostly as emission if the line excitation temperature is suf ﬁciently high.
__label__positive Given the similarity of their theoretical line pro ﬁle to our observations, we also ﬁtt h eH αemission with this radiative transfer model proposed by Roth & Kasen (2018 )for three different epochs.
__label__positive We consider a spherically symmetric, homologously expanding (v∝r)medium.
__label__positive A continuum photosphere is located at radius rph, which is responsible for emitting the observed continuum ﬂux at wavelengths near H αat the time of interest.
__label__positive The gas density falls off as r−2at radii beyond rphout to a maximum radius rout, where the velocity is vmax.
__label__positive The line absorption opacity κland the line Doppler width vDare set to single values at all positions outside the continuum photo- sphere.
__label__positive The line excitation is set by Tex=a+b/r, where a andbare chosen so that the line excitation temperature equals a speciﬁed value Tex,phat the photosphere and Tex,out atrout.
__label__positive The Sobolev approximation can then be used to calculate the observed emission by integrating the line source function along lines of sight passing through the line-emitting material, as inJeffery & Branch (1990 )and Roth & Kasen (2018 ).
__label__positive The strength of the emission line with respect to the continuum ﬂuxis then related to the Sobolev depth τ Sat each radius: tp r k=- rr vdv dr.5 Sl D1 ⎜⎟⎛ ⎝⎞ ⎠() () () For the conditions considered here, the electron-scattering optical depth is negligible for the line photons.
__label__positive Rather than perform a full multidimensional ﬁt, we set all parameters to the ﬁducial values listed in Table 6and then adjust the value of τS(rph)between spectral epochs until we judge by eye that a satisfactory ﬁt has been achieved.
__label__positive The continuum ﬂux is also adjusted between epochs to match what is observed.
__label__positive The resulting values are listed in Table 7.G i v e nt h ed e ﬁnition of τS, the values of κlandvDare degenerate in this formulation, since only their product enters into the calculation, as long as vD=vmax.

__label__positive NIIIλ4640 Å, a strong transition of the Bowen ﬂuorescence (BF) mechanism, emission lines are r eadily detected on day 248, while the detections are somewhat tentative on day 169.
__label__positive In BF, the HeIILyαphotons at 303.783 Åcan excite a number of nearby transitions, which decay into optical emission lines such as OIII(at 3133, 3429, and 3444 Å)and N IIIλ4640 Å.E m i s s i o n lines of BF have been detected in systems such as planetary nebulae and X-ray binaries and also in TDE iPTF15af (Blagorodnova et al.
__label__positive The late appearance of the He IIλ4686 emission is unlike most other TDEs to date (e.g., PS1-10jh; Gezari et al.
__label__positive 2012 ), where hydrogen emission is often suppressed relative to heliumat early times (Roth et al.
__label__positive The absence of the He IIλ4686 line may be attributed to the lack of He IIionizing photons (χion=54.4 eV )at earlier times.
__label__positive This is supported by the fact that the blackbody temperature of AT2018zr is coolerthan many other TDEs at ﬁrst but warms up drastically at later times (van Velzen et al.
__label__positive The hot continuum indicated by the late-time Swift observations would naturally explain the emergence of the He IIλ4686 emission.
__label__positive The broad H αand H βemission had become extremely weak when we revisited this source on Δt=169 days.
__label__positive Instead, narrow H αand H βemission emerged at a velocity close to the rest frame of the host galaxy.
__label__positive The most striking difference is found in the H αand H βlines, which are now dominated by two strong narrow components, whereas the broad H αand Hβemission have vastly diminished, though they can still be seen.
__label__positive We measured H αand H βin the late-time spectra with a double Gaussian model, where both broad and narrowcomponents are initially centered at the rest wavelength of the transition.
__label__positive The newly formed narrow H αand H βemission has FWHMs on the order of 1000 kms−1, which correspond to a virial radius of∼6×1017cm assuming a black hole mass of 107Me.

__label__positive We compare its HST spectrum with the other three —ASASSN-14li, iPTF15af, and iPTF16fnl —in Figure 9(Cenko et al.
__label__positive The H αline pro ﬁles, with ﬁts to a spherical out ﬂow model for the broad emission.
__label__positive An additional absorption component at the highest velocities is discussed in Section 4.1.
__label__positive Velocity pro ﬁles of He IIλ4686 H βand H αof AT2018zr at Δt=50, 169, and 248 days.
__label__positive Narrow H α,Hβ, and He IIλ4686 emission emerged 6 months after maximum light.
__label__positive The narrow line widths are on theorder of 1000 km s−1, which is only ∼10% of the broad Balmer line widths from earlier epochs.
__label__positive We note that on day 50, H αand H βhave a similar velocity pro ﬁle that is dented on the red wing, which is likely to arise from the geometry of the line-forming region.
__label__positive 10The Astrophysical Journal, 879:119 (17pp ), 2019 July 10 Hung et al.
__label__positive For comparison, we also show a composite spectrum of LoBALQSOs from the FIRST Bright Quasar Survey (Brotherton et al.
__label__positive Because the high-velocity absorption features were weak or completely absent in the ﬁrst two HST epochs, we are able to identify that the emission peaks of Ly αand Si IVλ1397 are blueshifted by ∼3000 km s−1with respect to the TDE rest frame.
__label__positive The only object that exhibit blueshifted UV emission(Lyα,S i IVλ1397 )among the TDEs is AT2018zr.
__label__positive In ASASSN-14li, the emission lines are near the systemic hostvelocity (Cenko et al.
__label__positive 2016 ), while in iPTF15af and iPTF16fnl, the emission lines are systematically redshifted (Blagorodnova et al.
__label__positive The velocity of the emission lines may arise from a combination of effects, including the geometry, kinematics, and optical depth.
__label__positive In iPTF15af,the redshifted broad emission lines are most likely caused bythe absorption of the blue wing at v≈−5000 km s −1.
__label__positive (2018 )obtained three epochs of HST spectra of iPTF16fnl spanning a time coverage of ∼1 month.
__label__positive While analyzing the evolution of iPTF16fnl, they found different evolution of thecentral wavelength for high- and low-ionization lines.
__label__positive Speci-ﬁcally, they found that the high-ionization emission lines were initially redshifted by v∼2000 km s −1but then evolved to peak near the wavelengths of the corresponding transitions atlater times, while the low-ionization lines showed no apparentshift at any given time.
__label__positive Since the UV spectrum of iPTF16fnlexhibits blueshifted absorption troughs for Si IVλ1397 and CIVλ1549 (FWHM ∼6000 km s−1), they suggested that the redshifted emission peaks may be due to the blue wings of theemission lines being signi ﬁcantly absorbed as a result of anoutﬂow at earlier times.
__label__positive This would be consistent with our ﬁnding that the BAL system is fast-evolving, on a timescale of days to weeks.
__label__positive On the other hand, the peak of Ly αand Si IVλ1397 emission in AT2018r did not show any signi ﬁcant shift during the HST monitoring.
__label__positive It is commonly observed in QSOs that the high-ionization lines (e.g., C IVλ1549 )are systematically blueshifted with respect to the low-ionization lines (e.g., Gaskell 1982 ; Richards et al.
__label__positive This blueshift is often attributed to the presence of a radiatively driven wind (Gaskell 1982 ; Murray et al.
__label__positive This may also be responsible for blueshifting (v≈ 3000 km s−1)the Si IVλ1397 and even the Ly αemission in AT2018zr.
__label__positive In fact, the velocity pro ﬁle of the strong, blueshifted Lyαemission is more similar to the Si IVλ1397 emission than to the H αemission (Figure 10).
__label__positive In the class of AGNs with double-peaked broad Balmer emission lines, it has beenobserved that the Ly αemission tends to be single-peaked and narrower in width (Eracleous & Halpern 2003 ).
__label__positive This difference has been attributed to Ly αbeing emitted from higher-ionization gas originating in a wind, compared tohigher-density gas in the accretion disk producing the low-ionization lines (Eracleous & Halpern 2003 ).
__label__positive Based on the similar velocity, the observed Ly αemission may naturally form in the same out ﬂowing gas with intermediate velocity (v≈3000 km s −1)as the Si IVλ1397 emission.
__label__positive We measured aL yαluminosity of 5.08 ×1043erg s−1from the ﬁrstHST epoch, which is at least 2 orders of magnitude stronger than theHαemission observed on the same night and 10 times larger than the expected value from case B recombination (≈8.7 ).
__label__positive This could be a consequence of continuum ﬂuorescence in the Lyman lines (Gaskell 2017 ).Figure 9.
__label__positive The gray dashed line at the bottom of each TDE spectrum marks the continuum, which is approximated by a blackbody spectrum of the corresponding temperature.
__label__positive 11The Astrophysical Journal, 879:119 (17pp ), 2019 July 10 Hung et al.
__label__positive Broad Balmer Emission Lines In Figure 11, we show the evolution of the FWHM of H α and H βmeasured with the best- ﬁt double Gaussian model.
__label__positive The Hαline width of AT2018zr is comparable to ASASSN-14ae at earlier times but broader than that of the other TDEs by a factor of∼30%.
__label__positive The FWHMs of the broad H αand H βcomponents show little evolution before the 3 month long observational gap but decreased by a factor of 3 at late time.
__label__positive This long-term trend of line narrowing is also seen in other TDEs (Figure 11), such as ASASSN-14ae and ASASSN-14li (Holoien et al.
__label__positive 2014 ,2016b ), though the blackbody luminosity in AT2018zr did not decrease monotonically like in the other TDEs (van Velzen et al.
__label__positive (2019 ), the blackbody luminosity of AT2018zr decreased with time untilΔt peak ∼70 days post-peak and remained nearly constant up to Δtpeak ≈250 days.
__label__positive Nevertheless, neither the line-width evol- ution in AT2018zr nor that in other TDEs conforms with the results of AGN reverberation mapping, where the H αline width increases as the luminosity decreases due to lessrecombination at outer radii (Holoien et al.
__label__positive 2016b ), hence the absence of the low velocity dispersion components.
__label__positive The earlier (Δt58)broad H αFWHM corresponds to a virial radius of ≈1.5 ×1015cm, assuming a black hole mass of 106.9Me(van Velzen et al.
__label__positive During this period, the broad Hα/Hβline ratio follows the case B value closely, with a mean of 3.1 and a standard deviation of 0.8.
__label__positive At late time, the average Hα/Hβline ratio is 7.1 ±0.9.
__label__positive The measured narrow HeIIλ4686/Hαratio from the last spectrum (Δt=248 days ) is≈0.4, which is consistent with the case B prediction assuming solar abundance (Hung et al.
__label__positive The presence of strong He IIλ4686 emission implies a strong ionizing con- tinuum beyond 54 eV and gas with a high ionization parameter (Gaskell & Rojas Lobos 2014 ).
__label__positive Theﬂat-topped line pro ﬁle in AT2018zr is unique among the optical TDEs discovered so far.
__label__positive In AGNs, the ﬂat-topped lineshape is often attributed to the orbital motion of a Keplerian disk.
__label__positive Double-peaked emission lines have been observed in many AGNs, which are believed to originate from the outerpart of an accretion disk at ≈1000 r g(e.g., Chen et al.
__label__positive 2003 ; Gaskell 2009 ) illuminated by a central ionizing source.
__label__positive In addition to Doppler broadening, relativistic effects are incorporated to model the asymmetries seen in the double-peaked emission lines.
__label__positive Forexample, a circular relativistic disk model (Chen et al.
__label__positive 1989 ; Mathews 1982 )is often employed to explain AGN spectra where the emission lines have a double-peaked shape with astronger blue peak.
__label__positive The opposite case, in which the red peak is stronger, could be achieved with an elliptical disk (Eracleous et al.
__label__positive Such a model has been employed in ﬁtting TDE lines in several cases, for example, PTF09djl (Liu et al.
__label__positive Motivated by the theoretical line pro ﬁles of an elliptical disk, Holoien et al.
__label__positive (2018 )modeled the H αline of AT2018zr (PS18kh )at different epochs with the combining effects of an elliptical disk, a spiral arm, and wind.
__label__positive Their model provides a reasonable ﬁt to the observed H αemission line shape.
__label__positive However, we ﬁnd very little evidence for the double-peaked Hαline pro ﬁle as claimed by Holoien et al.
__label__positive We suspect that the dip around line center in their data is most likely due to the host starlight, which may not have been cleanly removed.
__label__positive As shown by their ﬁt, the observed line center ﬂux always drops more steeply than what the elliptical disk model can reproduce.
__label__positive Furthermore, for a pure Keplerian disk, a ﬂat-top line is only expected under very speciﬁc conditions, i.e., when the disk rotation axis is 15° (Landt et al.
__label__positive In addition, the X-ray observations favor the presence of an accretion disk ( van Velzen et al.
__label__positive 2019 ), which is not expected in the elliptical disk model.
__label__positive Evolution of the FWHM of H α(red circles )and H β(red squares ) for AT2018zr compared with the FWHM evolution of H αfor other well- studied TDEs.
__label__positive The H αand H βline widths declined much slower at early times than the other TDEs.
__label__positive The late-time line widths are almost as narrow as ASASSN-14li.
__label__positive The FWHMs of the narrow components are shown with open symbols.Figure 10.
__label__positive Velocity pro ﬁles of the Ly α,S iIVλ1397, and H αemission lines at Δt=36 days.
__label__positive Both Ly αand Si IVλ1397 show a systemic blueshift of ∼3000 km s−1relative to H α, which suggests the lines were formed in locations with different kinematics.
__label__positive 12The Astrophysical Journal, 879:119 (17pp ), 2019 July 10 Hung et al.
__label__positive do not circularize ef ﬁciently, the streams may retain high eccentricities without forming a standard accretion disk(Svirski et al.
__label__positive In this model, streams may plunge directly into the black hole when some of the angularmomentum is removed, without losing any energy.
__label__positive Lastly,the outer radius of the elliptical disk derived by Holoien et al.(2018 )is on the order of 15,000 r g, which is almost 2 orders of magnitude greater than the self-intersection radius of anonspinning black hole with M BH=106.9Me(e.g., Wevers et al.
__label__positive Overall, we do not ﬁnd it necessary to invoke the elliptical disk model to interpret the spectral line shape.
__label__positive Our sphericaloutﬂow model provides a natural explanation for the ﬂat- topped line shape.
__label__positive Interestingly, the maximum out ﬂow velocity v max ∼1.75 ×104km s−1employed by our model is consis- tent with the velocity of the BAL system.
__label__positive This coincidence maybe explained if the absorption lines are produced by thisspherically expanding material at its outer edge when it scattersphotons outside our line of sight.
__label__positive High-velocity Transient BAL System Observations of AT2018zr indicate the presence of the ﬁrst transient LoBAL system in a TDE, in which both high- andlow-ionization absorption lines are present.
__label__positive In addition, thistransient LoBAL system contains intrinsic hydrogen Balmer,He I*λ3889, and He I*λ5876 absorption features.
__label__positive It turns out that such systems are very rare, even in QSOs.
__label__positive Blueshifted,broad high-ionization absorption lines are seen in about 10% – 20% of the optically selected QSOs (Hewett & Foltz 2003 ; Reichard et al.
__label__positive 2007 ) and are often attributed to accretion disk out ﬂows.
__label__positive However, only about 15% of the BALQSOs also show LoBALs such asMg IIλλ2796, 2803.
__label__positive A small fraction (15% )of the LoBAL QSOs that show Fe IIor Fe IIIabsorption, such as that in Mrk 231, are dubbed FeLoBALs (e.g., Veilleux et al.
__label__positive Since AT2018zr lacks common Fe IIabsorption in the NUV, it does notﬁt into the FeLoBAL category.
__label__positive Currently, there are only a handful of BALQSOs that exhibit hydrogen Balmer absorptionlines (e.g., Aoki 2010 ; Ji et al.
__label__positive Although stellar Balmer absorption lines are often seen in galaxy spectra, it is unlikely that the ones we see in AT2018zrare due to intervening galaxies or clouds for the followingreasons.
__label__positive First, high-ionization absorption troughs are detectedat the same velocities as the H Balmer absorption lines,suggesting a dynamical association between them.
__label__positive Second,multi-epoch optical spectra captured the appearance anddisappearance of the H Balmer absorptions on a timescale ofdays, which is unexpectedly short if the absorption is due tointervening gas.
__label__positive Third, the He I*λ3889 line must arise from the metastable 23S level, which is mainly populated by a recombination of singly ionized helium ions that require asigniﬁcant amount of photons with E>24.6 eV (Rudy et al.
__label__positive The He I*λ3889 is not seen in the interstellar medium, since the diffuse stellar background offers too few photons thatcan ionize helium and too many with E>4.8 eV that can ionize the electron in its metastable state.
__label__positive Lastly, since the TDEis relatively nearby, we should be able to resolve theintervening galaxies with imaging, yet we do not ﬁnd any.5.3.1.
__label__positive Out ﬂows Following a star ’s disruption, the mass initially falls back at a super-Eddington rate and gradually decreases below theEddington rate.
__label__positive Super-Eddington accretion is capable ofdriving powerful out ﬂows with radiation pressure (e.g., King & Pounds 2003 ; Ohsuga et al.
__label__positive Strubbe & Quataert (2011 )made the ﬁrst predictions of the spectroscopic signatures of super-Eddington out ﬂows in a TDE environment.
__label__positive Their predicted spectrum is characterized by broad, blueshifted(v wind ∼0.01c–0.1c)absorption features in the super-Edding- ton phase.
__label__positive Most of these absorption features are high-ionizationlines (χ ion>13.6 eV )because of the assumption of a hot continuum with a temperature T 10 bb5K.
__label__positive Since the velocity and density of the out ﬂow are viewing angle –dependent, their model is also able to produce spectra with more NUV andoptical absorption lines, such as Mg IIλλ2796, 2803 and the hydrogen Balmer lines, as a result of a softer continuum.
__label__positive Ingeneral, their model predicts a spectrum similar to that of aBALQSO and hence is similar to our observations ofAT2018zr.
__label__positive However, they predicted a rapid photospherictemperature evolution and a steep t −95/36(Strubbe & Quataert 2009 ; Lodato & Rossi 2011 )decline in optical ﬂux, which is not seen in the data.
__label__positive More recent work has re ﬁned the theoretical understanding of how TDEs might be associated with wide-angle out ﬂows.
__label__positive Miller (2015 )suggested that winds launched by radiation pressure on absorption lines may remove material as it is drawnin through an extended disk, which would lead to a range ofoutﬂow velocities.
__label__positive Metzger & Stone (2016 )studied mass- loaded winds launched by both accretion luminosity andenergy released during debris circularization.
__label__positive They foundminimum out ﬂow velocities of ∼10,000 km s −1, similar to the velocities measured here.
__label__positive They also pointed out that a shell ofpromptly launched material will surround the wind consistingof material that has fallen back more recently.
__label__positive Colder materialat the edge of this shell might provide the origin of theblueshifted absorption troughs seen in the optical spectra of thisevent.
__label__positive Another approach has been to perform hydrodynamic simulations of super-Eddington accretion ﬂows, accounting for the effects of radiation pressure, magnetic ﬁelds, and general relativity, and apply these ﬁndings to TDEs (Sa ̧dowski et al.
__label__positive (2018 )emphasized the viewing angle dependence of the out ﬂow and its resulting emission.
__label__positive While material ejected in the polar direction has arelativistic velocity and is transparent to X-rays, materiallaunched closer to the midplane has a slower velocity due tomass loading, and X-ray emission is highly suppressed alongthose lines of sight.
__label__positive The results for such a viewing geometry areconsistent with many aspects of this event, although the time-dependent behavior of this model requires further study.
__label__positive The simplest super-Eddington out ﬂow models assume that the wind velocity is a near-unity fraction of the escape velocityof the gas from the position where it is launched (Strubbe & Quataert 2009 ; Lodato & Rossi 2011 ).
__label__positive This would require the outﬂowing gas to be launched from a radius of ≈10 15cm to match the observed velocity of 0.05 cfor the absorption features, though the black hole mass estimation may besomewhat uncertain.
__label__positive However, this radius derived from thevelocity of the absorption features appears to be in tension withthe blackbody radius derived from the UV and optical 13The Astrophysical Journal, 879:119 (17pp ), 2019 July 10 Hung et al.
__label__positive The blackbody radius is found to be steadily decreasing from 1015.1cm near peak to 1014cm at Δt∼250 days (van Velzen et al.
__label__positive In this picture, the outﬂow would be launched at a radius slightly larger than that traced by the blackbody radius in AT2018zr when we ﬁrst observed the H βabsorption on day 30.
__label__positive Meanwhile, our modeling of the emission lines requires the continuumphotosphere to be located within the edge of the out ﬂow.
__label__positive Accounting for deviations from a pure blackbody emitter as appropriate for a scattering-dominated atmosphere would onlymove the thermalization radius of the continuum to smaller radii (e.g., Roth et al.
__label__positive A natural solution is for mass loading to reduce the ﬁnal velocity of the out ﬂow (Metzger & Stone 2016 ), allowing it to be originally launched from smaller radii while matching the velocity seen in the absorption features.
__label__positive The only other TDE in a quiescent galaxy that exhibits transient broad absorption features (in that case, Mg IIλλ2796, 2803 )with a comparable blueshift (13,000 km s−1)to AT2018zr (Chornock et al.
__label__positive The velocity of the absorbing material in PS1-11af is consistent with anoutﬂow launched near the blackbody radius (Chornock et al.
__label__positive On the other hand, the line width of Mg IIλλ2796, 2803 (FWHM ≈10,200 km s−1)in PS1-11af is much broader than the absorption lines in AT2018zr (FWHM ∼3000 km s−1for low-ionization lines and ∼10,000 km s−1for high-ionization lines ).
__label__positive The BALs are expected in the super-Eddington phase due to the wide range of gas velocities present in the out ﬂow.
__label__positive This gives rise to a line width that is similar to the wind velocity (Strubbe & Quataert 2011 ).
__label__positive The fact that the absorption lines in AT2018zr are narrower and detached fromtheir emission peaks may be a viewing angle effect.
__label__positive Forexample, a few BALQSOs have been reported with detached absorption troughs (e.g., PG 1254+046; Hamann 1998 ).
__label__positive This may happen when our line of sight does not align with the windsuch that the materials have already been substantially accelerated when it intersects our line of sight.
__label__positive Although many TDE spectroscopic features resemble those of BALQSOs, at least a fraction of the BALQSOs have low Eddington ratios (L/L Edd<0.1; Grupe & Nousek 2015 ), which must have a different mechanism to drive strong outﬂows.
__label__positive Indeed, the BALQSO wind is thought to be driven by line opacity in a partially ionized gas.
__label__positive In the line-drivenwind framework proposed by Murray et al.
__label__positive (1995 ), dense gas that shields the soft X-ray near the hot QSO ionizing source is required to avoid overionization and drive the BAL out ﬂows.
__label__positive Interestingly, the analysis of X-ray observations of AT2018zralso suggests some X-ray obscuring material residing outside the TDE photosphere (van Velzen et al.
__label__positive It is therefore also possible that the LoBAL in AT2018zr is powered by lineopacity, though most BALQSOs are associated with black holes that are too massive (M BH>108Me)to tidally disrupt solar-type stars (Strubbe & Quataert 2011 ).
__label__positive Despite the TDE sample with UV spectroscopic observations still being small, the fraction of TDEs that exhibit BAL featuresin the UV (three out of four; Section 5.1 )seems to be higher than the fraction (∼20% )of BALQSOs, which is often attributed to the orientation effect in disk winds.
__label__positive This maysuggest that the TDE out ﬂows have different geometries than the QSO out ﬂows and are less sensitive to viewing angle.
__label__positive Interestingly, the UV spectra of AT2018zr continue to supportthe coincidence of BALs in X-ray-weak TDEs, as suggested by Yang et al.
__label__positive Future HST observations of TDEs are desirable for verifying the large fraction of BALs in TDEs and their potential anticorrelation with X-ray emission.
__label__positive Unbound Debris Although the blueshifted absorption features are known to form in disk winds, we also consider the unbound stellar debris as a possible absorber.
__label__positive In a tidal disruption, about half of the disrupted star gains enough energy to escape the black hole ona hyperbolic trajectory, reaching a terminal velocity of11,000 km s −1(Krolik et al.
__label__positive Simulations by Strubbe & Quataert (2009 )showed that the unbound debris irradiated by the accretion disk will produce emission lines at the optical –IR wavelengths.
__label__positive It is therefore possible that the rapid evolution in density (ρ)and column density (N)of the unbound debris, where ρ∝t−3andN∝t−2, is causing the variability of the Balmer absorption seen on a timescale of a few days.
__label__positive However, the orientation required for an observer to see the high-velocity unbound debris stream, as depicted in Figure 12, will also cover the slower portions of the stream, as well as theinfalling bound stellar debris.
__label__positive The emergent spectra should, therefore, have broader line widths and even in ﬂow signatures.
__label__positive However, these are clearly inconsistent with our observations,where the photosphere is eclipsed by material at a radial velocity of 15,500 km s −1with a small dispersion of only ∼3000 km s−1.
__label__positive Physical Conditions Throughout the monitoring period, no signi ﬁcant accelera- tion or deacceleration in the absorbing material is detected, Figure 12.
__label__positive To-scale sketch of the stellar debris at the time corresponding to the spectral out ﬂow signature.
__label__positive The red and blue curves trace out the out ﬂowing and inﬂowing stellar debris streams, respectively.
__label__positive The viewing geometry is chosen to allow the unbound debris to provide the high-velocity absorption lines.However, in such a geometry, a wide range of gas velocities in the debrisstream would intercept the optical photosphere, so we ultimately disfavor the debris stream as the origin of the high-velocity absorption lines.
__label__positive In order to identify the features of this diagram more clearly, we have stretched thehorizontal distance axis by a factor of 5.
__label__positive We have referred to Coughlin et al.(2016 )to determine the radial location of the portion of the stream at zero radial velocity.
__label__positive 14The Astrophysical Journal, 879:119 (17pp ), 2019 July 10 Hung et al.
__label__positive given the fact that the absorption features did not show any signiﬁcant velocity offset between different epochs.
__label__positive Assuming the absorbing material has been traveling at constant velocity(v=15,500 km s−1)since peak light (tpeak ), it would have reached a distance of ∼5×1015cm by the time we ﬁrst observed the H βabsorption at Δt∼30 days.
__label__positive This distance is just outside of the continuum photosphere estimated from the blackbody ﬁt(van Velzen et al.
__label__positive Observations have revealed a handful of QSOs with hydrogen Balmer and /or metastable helium lines in their BAL systems.
__label__positive Comparisons of these observations with photoionization models have constrained the ionization para- meters and densities of the out ﬂows with the photoionization code CLOUDY , which, in turn, can constrain the kinetic luminosities of the out ﬂows.
__label__positive Below, we summarize the physical conditions that give rise to the hydrogen Balmer andhelium lines based on these works.
__label__positive In particular, we referencethe values derived with CLOUDY version 17.00 (Ferland et al.
__label__positive (2019 ), given the presence of similar species in the transient absorber in PG 1411 +442.
__label__positive (2019 )employed plane-parallel clouds with solar abundances and an input continuum with a broken power-law form f ν∝να, where αUV=−0.5 and −0.9.
__label__positive In general, the TDE disk spectrum is thought to be harder thanthat of an AGN, given the smaller size of the accretion disk.
__label__positive Although this high-energy tail of X-ray emission is rarely seen in optically selected TDEs, it has been suggested thatthe HeII4686 and Bowen emission lines may be indirectevidence for extreme UV or reprocessed X-ray emission (e.g., Blagorodnova et al.
__label__positive Strong helium transitions from the metastable 2 s level occur atλ3889 and λ10830, which correspond to transitions from the metastable state to the 3 pand 2 pstates, respectively.
__label__positive Although once considered a rare phenomenon, Liu et al.
__label__positive (2015 )found a high association rate between He I*λ3889 and the MgIIλλ2796, 2803 doublet among BALQSOs with high-S / N spectra (93% at S /N35).
__label__positive (2011 ) demonstrated that the He I*λ3889 and He I*λ10830 lines can serve as a powerful diagnostic of high column density out ﬂow.
__label__positive This is due to the large λfikratio16of 23.3, which makes the HeI*lines sensitive to a wide range of high column densities (τ∝Nionλfik)before saturating.
__label__positive Unfortunately, we are unable to carry out a similar analysis due to the He I*λ10830 line falling outside our spectroscopic coverage.
__label__positive The presence of HeI*λ5876 provides additional constraints on the ionized gas.
__label__positive Unlike He I*λ3889, He I*λ5876 arises from an energy state that is not metastable and is readily depopulated by permitted radiative decays via the λ10830 transition when the gas density is low.
__label__positive Photoionization calculations have shown that a gasdensity of log (n H/cm−3)7 and an ionized column density of log (NH/cm−2)23 are required to produce τ0(5876 )∼0.1 (Hamann et al.
__label__positive The inferred high density and column density are required to populate the highly excited states and form the He I*λ5876 absorption line regardless of the exact ionizing spectrum.
__label__positive The blueshift velocity of AT2018zr is the highest among QSOs with Balmer BALs (Zhang et al.
__label__positive Behind the hydrogen recombination front, the partially ionized regions thatgive rise to the H Balmer absorption lines usually have highdensities (typically n e∼106–9cm−3; Zhang et al.
__label__positive Our analysis of the H Balmer absorption lines has shown that even the high-order hydrogen Balmertransitions are saturated.
__label__positive Photoionization modeling with CLOUDY suggests that a density of - nlog cm 6.5 H3() and a column density of- Nlog cm 23.
__label__positive 2 H2() are required to produce τ0(Hγ)1.3 regardless of the ionization parameter U (Hamann et al.
__label__positive With the above estimation of density and column density, a cloud size of 1016cm can be inferred from NH/nH(assuming log (nH/cm−3)=7 and- Nlog cm 2 3 H2() ).
__label__positive Assuming a spherical cloud, we estimate a total mass of 4.4 ×10−3Me and a kinetic energy of 1049erg.
__label__positive The mass and kinetic energy of the out ﬂow in AT2018zr are about an order of magnitude greater than that in ASASSN-14li, which is known to host anoutﬂow with comparable velocity (12,000 –36,000 km s−1),a s derived from radio observations (Alexander et al.
__label__positive Note that radio emission, which is expected as the out ﬂow shocks against the circumnuclear matter (CNM ), is not detected in AT2018zr at a 3 σupper limit of 1037erg s−1at 10 GHz (van Velzen et al.
__label__positive While the HST data show unambiguous evidence for the presence of an out ﬂow, the nondetection at the radio frequency may be due to the radio signal being buried by the dense CNM.
__label__positive Detailed, accurate characterization of the broad emission and absorption lines in the UV is necessary for robust estimation of the transient absorber properties (e.g., column density ).I n particular, the column density and density are criticalparameters to measure the kinetic luminosity, which can be used to examine different TDE out ﬂow models and assess their importance in the context feedback in galaxy evolution.
__label__positive Conclusion We report the results of our analysis of multi-epoch UV and optical spectra of the TDE AT2018zr observed between 2018March and December.
__label__positive The wide wavelength coverage of the HST STIS UV spectra (∼1150–3000 Å), together with the Keck LRIS spectra (∼3500–9000 Å), allows us to identify highly blueshifted (15,500 km s −1, or 0.05 c)BALs in the UV and optical, including the high- and low-ionization transitions seen in LoBAL QSOs.
__label__positive In this BAL system, we identi ﬁed the ﬁrst hydrogen Balmer and metastable He I transitions, which are known to be rare in QSOs, in a TDE.
__label__positive We conclude that this BAL system is more likely the result of a high-velocity out ﬂow launched by TDE accretion ﬂows, instead of the unbound debris.
__label__positive Given that the presence of broad UV absorption lines is more common in TDEs (three out of four )than in QSOs, this may suggest that the out ﬂow launching mechanisms in TDEs are less subjective to orientation effects than those in QSOs.
__label__positive Our curve-of-growth analysis shows that even the high-order hydrogen Balmer absorption lines are saturated, and theabsorbing material only covers the background source partially.
__label__positive By comparing with photoionization models for AGNs, we conclude that the ionized gas must be characterized by a highdensity (log (n H/cm−3)7)and high column (log (NH/cm−2)23)based on the detection of He I*λ3889 and HeI*λ5876.
__label__positive The inference of high density and high column is not very sensitive to the exact ionizing spectrum.
__label__positive In order to give rise to the H Balmer absorption, the partially ionized gas behind the hydrogen recombination front must also have highcolumn densities.
__label__positive More UV and optical spectroscopic observa-tions of TDEs will allow detailed photoionization modeling to 16Here λfik (wavelength of the transition ×oscillator strength )is a measurement of the optical depth of an absorption line (see Equation (3)).

__label__positive assess whether TDE out ﬂows provide signi ﬁcant“feedback ”in the context of galaxy evolution.
__label__positive Using a radiative transfer model, we show that the emission proﬁle seen in expanding TDE out ﬂows (Roth & Kasen 2018 ) is similar to the ﬂat-topped H αline shape in our observations.
__label__positive Weﬁnd that the spherical out ﬂow model alone, with a maximum velocity of 1.75 ×104km s−1close to the velocity of the aforementioned BAL, provides a satisfactory ﬁt to the observed line pro ﬁle.
__label__positive While the elliptical disk model has been invoked to interpret emission lines in several TDEs, it requiresstringent conditions in order to produce the line shape inAT2018zr.
__label__positive Furthermore, the implied disk size from theelliptical disk model is 2 orders of magnitude larger than thestream self-intersection radius, which is dif ﬁcult to explain from the perspective of debris stream dynamics.
__label__positive We report the appearance of narrow He IIλ4686, H α, and Hβemission lines in the late-time optical spectra of AT2018zr.
__label__positive The line widths of these transitions imply a virial radius on theorder of 1017cm.
__label__positive We suggest that the presence of He IIλ4686 and N IIIλ4640 emission in later observations may be driven by the temperature increase in the late-time UV and opticalcontinuum.
__label__positive The TDE spectra are thought to be rather featureless; hence, the spectroscopic analysis has been focused on the emissionlines in the past.
__label__positive We emphasize that subtle features, such as thehighly blueshifted H Balmer absorption lines in AT2018zr,may also be present in TDE spectra as a result of out ﬂows.
__label__positive High-S /N spectra with broad wavelength coverage are critical for identifying these absorption features in the UV and optical.
__label__positive We also recommend monitoring future TDEs with spectrosc-opy on a weekly basis, since, as we have shown withAT2018zr, the spectroscopic features —both emission and absorption —are variable on such a timescale.

__label__positive 13–15, 1121 Budapest, Hungary e-mail: kovacs@konkoly.hu Received 12 June 2017 / Accepted 6 March 2018 ABSTRACT The distribution of the stellar rotation axes of 113main sequence stars in the open cluster Praesepe are examined by using current photometric rotation periods, spectroscopic rotation velocities, and estimated stellar radii.
__label__positive Three different samples of stellar rotation data on spotted stars from the Galactic ﬁeld and two independent samples of planetary hosts are used as control samples to support the consistency of the analysis.
__label__positive Considering the high completeness of the Praesepe sample and the behavior of the control samples, we ﬁnd that the main sequence F Kstars in this cluster are susceptible to rotational axis alignment.
__label__positive Using a cone model, the most likely inclination angle is 7614with a half opening angle of 4724.
__label__positive Non-isotropic distribution of the inclination angles is preferred over the isotropic distribution, except if the rotation velocities used in this work are systematically overestimated.
__label__positive We found no indication of this being the case on the basis of the currently available data.
__label__positive stars: rotation – open clusters and associations: individual: M 44 1.
__label__positive Introduction Current space- and ground-based surveys have made a signiﬁ- cant contribution to our understanding of stellar rotation (e.g., McQuillan et al.
__label__positive Because stellar rotation carries information on the angular momentum evolution of the stars themselves and on the whole cluster (but in a rather involved way), these data are also relevant for understanding the poorly known early phase of cluster evolu- tion, including the loss of angular momentum, the importance of gas dynamics, turbulence, and the magnetic ﬁeld (e.g., McKee & Ostriker 2007).
__label__positive (2017) on the apparent large degree of rotational axis alignment in two old clusters, here we examine the distribution of the line-of-sight component of the orientation of the rotational axes of 113main sequence stars in the 0:8Gyr old cluster Praesepe.
__label__positive To derive the inclination angles we use spectroscopic and photometric rotational data combined with stellar radii from stellar evolution models.
__label__positive The distribution of the inclination angles derived in this way are modeled by various assumptions on their underlying distributions.
__label__positive Praesepe The dataset we used is based primarily on the availability of spectroscopically derived rotational velocities.
__label__positive The 152 stars ?Data are only available at the CDS, together with the other two compiled datasets used in this paper, via anony- mous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5 ) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/612/L2listed in Mermilliod et al.
__label__positive (2009) with possible cluster mem- bership have been cross-correlated with the 180stars from the HATNet1survey Kovács et al.
__label__positive (2014) and with the 941 stars recently published by Rebull et al.
__label__positive After various ﬁlter steps (e.g., lack of vsini2, stars with multiple matches) we ended up with 120stars that all have 2MASS (Skrutskie et al.
__label__positive 2006) and Vcolors (nearly exclu- sively from APASS: Henden et al.
__label__positive 2016), spectroscopic and pho- tometric rotational data (available at the CDS, together with the other two compiled datasets used in this paper).
__label__positive No cut was made on the basis of the value of vsini, period, and color.
__label__positive Furthermore, because of the high pre- cision of the K2 observations, the period sample is nearly com- plete; the periodic signal detection rate is 86% for the 941stars examined in the work of Rebull et al.
__label__positive The rotation peri- ods are also highly reliable, with an overall relative error of 3%, based on the comparison of the common stars in the Kovács et al.
__label__positive To estimate the inclination angle, we needed to derive stel- lar radii.
__label__positive To achieve this goal, we opted to use the IRFM-based Tecalibration of Huang et al.
__label__positive The observed magnitudes were dered- dened by assuming E(B V)=0:027and standard extinction law (see Taylor 2006; Yuan 2013).
__label__positive By considering the differ- ent reddenings used, our temperatures are consistent with those given by Cummings et al.
__label__positive (2017) in their chemical abundance analysis of the same cluster.
__label__positive These Tevalues were matched with theZ=0:0200 ,age=0:8Gyr PARSEC isochrone of Marigo et al.
__label__positive With Z=0:0152 used in the PARSEC models, the adopted metal abundance is consistent with those given in 1https://hatnet.org/ 2Throughout the paper we use the shorthand notation vsiniandsini, respectively, for the spectroscopic rotational velocity Veqsin(i)(with Veq for the equatorial velocity) and for the sine of the inclination angle.

__label__positive The interferometric radii collected by Boyajian et al.
__label__positive (2013) are shown by blue dots, those derived from the extrasolar planetary systems in the Kepler ﬁeld (Winn et al.
__label__positive 2017) by deep gray dots, and hot Jupiter hosts elsewhere (Maxted et al.
__label__positive 2015, extended/updated for this study) by yellow dots.
__label__positive The inset shows the same kind of plot, but using the large compilation of transiting planet hosts by Hartman et al.
__label__positive current spectroscopic studies (i.e., Boesgaard et al.
__label__positive The age used is in agreement with the value currently predicted by models including the effect of stel- lar rotation (Brandt & Huang 2015), but older than the standard age of0:6Gyr (e.g., Fossati et al.
__label__positive Because the stars stud- ied in this work are far from the turn-off luminosity of the cluster, this difference has no effect whatsoever on the results presented in this paper.
__label__positive Once the observed and isochrone temperatures are matched, the radii are estimated from the model luminosities, using the blackbody formula.
__label__positive To check the consistency between the radii determined above and those derived by various other methods, ﬁrst we took the database of (Bourgés et al.
__label__positive 2014, 2017) containing photometri- cally calibrated stellar angular diameters from direct interfero- metric data.
__label__positive Assuming a cluster distance of 182pc (e.g., van Leeuwen 2009), the angular diameter was converted to stellar diameter by using the formula R=R=19:56[mas].
__label__positive We see that the test dataset is rather sensitive to blending.
__label__positive Therefore, we think that the overall match of the isochrones with the part between the lower envelope andthe ridge supports the radii values used in the present work, based on the [Fe/H] = +0:12isochrone.
__label__positive 2) we performed a non-direct comparison by taking the interferometric data on 125Galactic ﬁeld stars published by Boyajian et al.
__label__positive In addition to these data we added the planetary host samples of hot Jupiters (HJs) and Kepler planets (KOIs) from Table 1 and the compilation of 199 planetary systems by Hartman et al.
__label__positive Again, with the obviously older age and wide metallicity spread of these ﬁeld star data, the isochrone used in this work for Praesepe (representing a relatively young and moderately metal-rich sample) seems to be well justiﬁed.
__label__positive Control samples We used ﬁve control samples to gain further support for the bet- ter assessment of the statistical signiﬁcance of the rotation angle distribution derived for Praesepe.
__label__positive These samples (see Table 1) were chosen under the assumption of near homogeneity of rota- tion axis distributions within each set.
__label__positive Because of the observed transits and the likely alignment of the stellar rotation and orbital angular momentum vectors, the two planet host samples are expected to show dominance of inclination angles close to 90 (exceptions are the few non-aligned systems; see Winn et al.
__label__positive On the other hand, the magnetic, chemically peculiar (MCP) stars of Field (A) and (B) are expected to have random rotational axis orientations, and therefore may serve as good con- trol groups for testing the isotropic distribution.
__label__positive The same is true for the spotted star sample Field (C), but they are members of the Kepler ﬁeld, and so there is basically no selection effect for the amplitude of the observable photometric variation.
__label__positive Therefore, objects with small inclination angles have an equal probability of being included in the sample; however, the limited accuracy ofvsinicould still pose some constraints on slow rotators.
__label__positive Two selection criteria are applied to all items used in the analysis: i) avoiding poorly determined periods, stars with Prot>40days are omitted, and ii) avoiding clearly bad items, stars with sini>2:0are omitted.
__label__positive Except for Field (B), where the stellar radii are calculated from the tabulated luminosity and effective temperature, we used the radii given in the respective publications.
__label__positive For Field (B) there are 1347 stars in the catalog of Netopil et al.
__label__positive (2017), but only 193stars have all the necessary parameters for this study.
__label__positive The Field (C) data resulted from the cross-correlation of several spectroscopic and photometric cat- alogs covering the Kepler ﬁeld (see Table 1 for the respective publications).
__label__positive Radii for this dataset are as given in the corre- sponding catalogs or were taken from Huber et al.
__label__positive 4 we ﬁrst make a simple comparison of the cumu- lative distribution functions (CDFs) for siniderived from the observedvsini, rotational period Prot, and estimated stellar radius Rstar.
__label__positive With the assumption of dominating equatorial spots in the derived rotational periods, we use the formula sini=vsini Prot=(2Rstar)to estimate sini.
__label__positive Second, after a brief classiﬁcation of the CDFs, following Jackson et al.
__label__positive (2010), we model the observed distributions by assuming various dis- tributions of iand considering the distortion caused by the observational errors on these theoretical distributions.

__label__positive Here P0 rot,R0 star, andvsini0denote the true stellar parameters, which we approximate with their observed/computed counter- parts.
__label__positive The errors :::are Gaussian, except for vsini, which can be nicely represented by a LogNormal distribution.
__label__positive The noise parameters are taken from the observations (see below).
__label__positive In modeling the observed CDF with a given distribu- tion of sini, we use Eq.
__label__positive (1) with 50different realizations of (sini;R;P;vsini)for all members of the sample.
__label__positive The CDFs of these siniobsvalues are computed and an average CDF is obtained with the corresponding standard deviations derived from the 50realizations.
__label__positive The quality of the ﬁt is parameterized by the RMS of the residuals between the target and the average CDF.
__label__positive Choosing the size of the error components in the modeling is important in general, and could be crucial in the interpre- tation of the resulting underlying distribution of sini.
__label__positive After an exhaustive series of tests, we decided to trust in the published errors and use them without any up- or down-scaling, depending on some consistency criteria that might be applied to the given dataset (e.g., using unreason- able down-scaling to reach better agreement with the expected aligned distribution for the planetary hosts).
__label__positive For the period and radius, the sources of the datasets include irregular noise infor- mation.
__label__positive Therefore, we decided to estimate the expected errors.
__label__positive Based on the comparison of the periods of Praesepe from Kovács et al.
__label__positive (2017), we found that the period errors are proportional to the period with a scaling factor of 0:03.
__label__positive For the radius errors we use the publication of Winn et al.
__label__positive The radius errors given in this publication show a reasonably tight correlation with the radii.
__label__positive In summary, assuming standard Gaussian distributions, we use the following error formulae P=GAUSS P0:03P0 rot; (2) R=GAUSS Rj0:27R0 star 0:2j: We note that the results presented in this paper are only mildly sensitive to the assumed noise in the period and radius.

__label__positive The entries show the probabilities P=Pr[dmax>dobs max], where dobs maxis the observed maximum difference between the CDFs of the pair of datasets tested.
__label__positive Low probabilities indicate that the two CDFs are drawn from different distributions.
__label__positive For easier comparison, the P>0:05 cases are in bold.
__label__positive Finally, the inclination angles are generated by following either the isotropic (Chandrasekhar & Münch 1950, see also Curé et al.
__label__positive While the isotropic model has no free parameters except for the generally accepted noise model for the dataset, the cone dis- tribution has two adjustable parameters: , the inclination of the axis of the cone, and , half of the opening angle of the cone.
__label__positive Best ﬁt cone parameters are searched for by a simple grid search in [0;=2]for both parameters.
__label__positive The errors on these parameters come from the possible parameter regimes allowed by the 1scatter of the realization-dependent standard devi- ations of the residuals between the target CDF and the best ﬁtting model.
__label__positive In the course of the error estimation, using the inverse of the CDF residuals as weights, the cone parameters are updated.
__label__positive Results First we compare the distributions of the sinivalues derived from the observations for the six datasets.
__label__positive Figure 3 shows the result of this comparison, clearly indicating the expected similar- ity of the various groups of stars.
__label__positive To make this statement more quantitative, we perform a two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test for the pairs of the datasets.
__label__positive As expected, Table 2 conﬁrms the classiﬁcation suggested by Fig.
__label__positive Although the rel- ative errors of vsinivary by several factors over the samples, there are datasets of similar quality that show markedly differ- ent distributions, for example Praesepe and the planet hosts, and similar distributions with signiﬁcantly different noise properties, for example set (C) in the ﬁeld star sample3.
__label__positive Therefore, the dif- ferences in the distributions likely reﬂect real differences in the distributions of the inclination angles.
__label__positive To model the underlying distribution of siniwe followed the methodology described in Sect.
__label__positive Figure 4 shows the result for the six datasets studied in this work.
__label__positive Starting with Praesepe, we see that the isotropic distribution is clearly dis- tinct from the observed distribution4.
__label__positive However, the shape of 3The relatively large K–S probability associated with the Praesepe – Field (C) samples is attributed in part to the small sample size of the latter.
__label__positive 4In testing the robustness of this result against binaries and blends, we omitted the 28CMD outliers shown in Fig.
__label__positive 1 and found that the distinctiveness of the two distributions remains, albeit with a lower sig- niﬁcance: the RMS between the two CDFs decreased from 0:076(full sample) to 0:062(without the CMD outliers).
__label__positive On the other hand, omit- ting only the 31spectroscopic binaries – half of them are not outliers – leads to an increase in the RMS to 0:095.

__label__positive The CDF for Praesepe is shown twice for easier comparison with the CDFs corresponding to the different datasets.

__label__positive This prompted us to investigate the possibility of the overestima- tion of the vsinivalues.
__label__positive (2009) data come from the long-term monitoring of this cluster by the CORA VEL instrument.
__label__positive The correlation proﬁles were modeled by Gaussians, assuming broadening factors from rotation, stel- lar turbulence, and instrumental effects (see Benz & Mayor 1984).

__label__positive Although this is still considerably far from the expected range of0(see Fig.
__label__positive 1998), it calls for even higher precision data to give a more reliable answer on the issue of zero point of the vsinidata.
__label__positive On the other hand, by checking other (even though sparse and, in general, less accurate) data sources on Praesepe (Cummings et al.
__label__positive 2017) we ﬁnd that most of the pub- lished values (80%) are an average of 10–20% higher than our values.
__label__positive Therefore, we think that the current data lend support to a non-isotropic inclination angle distribution rather than to the isotropic one.
__label__positive For the other datasets we see a comfortable overall consistency between the expected distributions and the best ﬁt- ting models.
__label__positive The optimal cone models (with large parameter scatter, as expected) are indistinguishable from the isotropic model for all ﬁeld star samples, although there is a slight indication for the underestimation of the observational noise for Field (C): the observed CDF is shallower than that of the isotropic distribution.

__label__positive To date, the only work suggesting stellar spin axis alignment in clusters is that of Corsaro et al.
__label__positive However, their result is based on small samples (25 stars for NGC 6791 and 23 stars for NGC 6819).
__label__positive The currently available data on Praesepe allow only a rather inaccurate estimation of the inclination angles.
__label__positive With the type of instrumentation used in the ﬁeld of extrasolar planets, the same accuracy of0:5km s 1invsinicould be reached.
__label__positive With a fur- ther improvement in the photometry and blend analysis, the error of the radius estimates could also be decreased to 3 5%; with the already accurate rotation periods, this would enable us to estimate siniwith an accuracy of 7 10%.
__label__positive This is a two- to threefold decrease in error compared with what we have now.
__label__positive Our ﬁndings in this work and those of Corsaro et al.
__label__positive (2017) are very difﬁcult to understand by current stellar formation and cluster evolution theories.
__label__positive It is hard to see how some compli- cated magnetohydrodynamic effects can lead to even broadly organized spin axis distribution on a gigayear timescale after the star formation period.
__label__positive At this moment we think that the most effective way to make progress in the more secure disentangling of the various types of distribution is to acquire more accurate spectroscopic rotational velocities as described above.
__label__positive This, together with a better esti- mation of the noise budget, will most likely lead to a cleaner observational input for the theory of rotational axis alignment.

__label__positive Most Galactic and extragalactic clusters exhibit internal variations of He, C, N, O, Na, and Al.
__label__positive They host two distinct stellar populations: the ﬁrst population of stars, which resemble ﬁeld stars with similar metallicities, and one or more second stellar populations that show the signature of high-temperature H-burning.
__label__positive In addition, a sub-sample of clusters hosts stellar populations with different heavy-element abundances.
__label__positive The MP origin remains one of the most puzzling, open issues of stellar astrophysics.
__label__positive We summarize the scenarios for the MP formation and depict the modern picture of GCs and their stellar populations along with the main evolutionary phases.
__label__positive We show that the MP behavior dramatically changes from one cluster to another and investigate their complexity to deﬁne common properties.
__label__positive We investigate relations with the host galaxy, the parameters of the host clusters (e.g., GC’s mass, age, orbit), and stellar mass.
__label__positive We summarize results on spatial distribution and internal kinematics of MPs.
__label__positive Finally, we review the relation between MPs and the so-called second-parameter problem of the horizontal-branch morphology of GCs and summarize the main ﬁndings on the extended main sequence phenomenon in young clusters.
__label__positive Keywords: globular clusters; open clusters; stars: population II 1.
__label__positive Introduction Being among the oldest objects in the Milky Way, globular clusters (GCs) provide a privileged observation window into the Universe’s infancy.
__label__positive They hold stellar fossil records which are used in Galactic archaeology to uncover the history of the Primordial Universe by observing the Local Universe (e.g., [1]).
__label__positive For many years, GCs have served as laboratories for testing the predictions of stellar evolution models since their stars were considered the best example of a simple stellar pop- ulation, a population of monometallic and coeval stars from which estimates of distances and ages can be obtained [2].
__label__positive For a long time, astronomers believed that GC stars formed out of one single burst of star formation and used the GC simplicity to constrain the main properties of a stel- lar population.
__label__positive Realizing that these stellar systems host multiple stellar populations has unavoidably changed our perspective, making the presence of more than one stellar pop- ulation in GCs one of the most astonishing discoveries in the ﬁeld of stellar populations in recent years.
__label__positive Most Galactic GCs originated at redshifts higher than 3 [3], when only a small fraction (6%) of the Milky Way stellar mass was formed [ 4].
__label__positive Hence, the origin of GCs and their stellar populations precedes the assembly of most of the Galaxy, thus shedding new light on the early Galaxy formation [5].
__label__positive https://doi.org/10.3390/universe8070359 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/universe
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 2 of 41 Historically, three observational facts have challenged the notion of GCs as simple stellar populations.
__label__positive It has long been known that the chemical composition of stars in GCs is not homogeneous in the elements involved in hot H-burning, such as C, N, O, Na, Al, and in some cases Mg, Si, and K.
__label__positive The variations in these light elements set well- known chemical patterns, such as the O–Na/C–N, and the Mg–Al anticorrelations (see [ 6–9], for reviews).
__label__positive Stars with lower N and Na and higher C and O resemble Galactic-ﬁeld stars with the same metallicity, while stars enhanced in N and Na and depleted in C and O are mostly found in GCs.
__label__positive • The second parameter of the horizontal branch indicates the phenomenon discov- ered in the 1960s that GCs with similar metallicities exhibit different horizontal branch (HB) morphologies [10–12].
__label__positive • Multiple sequences in the color magnitude diagram.
__label__positive Since the late 1990s, there has been growing evidence of split or broad main sequences (MSs), red giant branches (RGBs), and sub-giant branches (SGBs) in GCs [ 13–21].
__label__positive A discovery that dates back to the past decade is that the CMDs of nearly all GCs are composed of multiple sequences that can be followed continuously, along with all evolutionary phases, from the bottom of the MS toward the RGB tip and also along the HB, the asymptotic giant branch AGB, and even the white dwarf cooling sequence [22–27].
__label__positive Recently, some pioneering studies on M4 revealed that chemical anomalies, multiple photometric sequences on the CMD, and the distribution of stars along the HB are different sides of the same phenomenon [ 19,28], which we call multiple population phenomenon.
__label__positive In the following, we indicate stars with Galactic-ﬁeld-like chemical composition as the ﬁrst population (1P).
__label__positive The sample of stars enhanced in He, N, Na, and Al and depleted in C and O deﬁne one or more subsequent stellar populations, dubbed altogether as second populations (2Ps).
__label__positive Understanding the origin of the multiple stellar population phenomenon is a challenge for stellar evolution, stellar nucleosynthesis, and the star formation mechanisms at high redshift.
__label__positive Some theoretical scenarios assume that the multiple stellar populations correspond to different generations of stars, with multiple star formation events taking place.
__label__positive The ﬁrst burst of star formation would form stars out of pristine material.
__label__positive Later, one or more subsequent events would build stellar populations from the ashes of more massive ﬁrst- population stars, which evolve faster (e.g., [29–32]).
__label__positive However, some of the observational constraints, such as the fact that 2P stars represent the majority of stars in most clusters [ 24,33], are hardly reconcilable with a scenario of multiple bursts of star formation.
__label__positive To ﬁt this scenario, we need to assume that proto-GCs were some order of magnitudes more massive than their progeny.
__label__positive Such massive clusters would contribute to the Milky-Way assembly and even possibly the cosmic reionization [5].
__label__positive Because of this demanding requirement, it has also been proposed that multiple stellar populations in GCs form in a single burst of star formation, with a fraction of stars being polluted by the ejecta of more massive stars of the same generation [34,35].
__label__positive As of now, we do not properly understand the origin of multiple stellar populations in GCs.
__label__positive In recent years, various excellent reviews have been dedicated to GCs and their stellar populations (e.g., [ 6–9,36,37]).
__label__positive Here, we discuss the state of the art of observed properties of multiple stellar populations in GCs by focusing on recent results, largely based on photometry.
__label__positive We also provide a brief discussion on the formation scenarios and their challenges.
__label__positive We start discussing the main observational tools to identify and characterize multiple populations in GCs (Section 2).
__label__positive We then deﬁne the different classes of GCs in Section 3 and summarize the scenarios for the formation of multiple populations in Section 4.
__label__positive Section 5 describes the chemical composition of stellar populations, whereas Section 6 illustrates the main properties of multiple populations.
__label__positive Section 7 is dedicated to the second-parameter problem of the HB morphology, while Section 8 discusses the extended main sequence turn offs and split main sequences of
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 3 of 41 young clusters (ages smaller than 2 Gyr).
__label__positive Finally, in Section 9 we provide a short list of observations that in our opinion could help shed light on the multiple population phenomenon.
__label__positive Observational Tools to Disentangle Multiple Populations in GCs For a long time, spectroscopy has been the main technique to characterize GC stellar populations ([ 6,38,39], and references therein).
__label__positive In the past two decades, the synergy between complementary techniques, spectroscopy and photometry, had a crucial role in guiding the design of new and more efﬁcient observations to explore the multiple stellar populations.
__label__positive After the pioneering study of M4, which revealed that stars with different light-element abundance deﬁne distinct sequences in the CMD [ 19], we started gaining knowledge on how to construct new effective tools to investigate the different stellar populations in GCs.
__label__positive The new tools that have been introduced are based on multiband photometric tech- niques but also involve spectral synthesis and elemental abundance inferred from spectra, which provide the chemical key to reading the photometric diagrams.
__label__positive In this context, a major contribution for the construction of high-precision photometric diagrams, which are very efﬁcient in identifying distinct stellar populations, has certainly been provided by the innovative methods of photometric data analysis developed by Jay Anderson and his collaborators (e.g., [ 40,41]).
__label__positive These methods, which are based on an effective point-spread function, have allowed obtaining high-precision photometry from images collected with the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) and ground-based facilities.
__label__positive In the following items, we provide a summary of the basic photometric ingredients that are effective to maximize the separation between stellar populations with different chemical compositions.
__label__positive We describe the new diagrams that have been the key tools to identify and characterize multiple populations in a large sample of clusters.
__label__positive CMDs made with U-band photometry are pow- erful tools to identify multiple stellar populations along different evolutionary phases.
__label__positive In their aforementioned pivotal paper on the nearest GC, M4, Marino et al.
__label__positive [19] have demonstrated that it is possible to disentangle stellar populations with different chem- ical compositions by using wideband ground-based photometry.
__label__positive Indeed, stars with different abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sodium deﬁne distinct RGB sequences in the Uvs.U BCMD.
__label__positive The main reason for the RGB split is that the U ﬁlter includes NH and CN molecular bands, whereas the Bﬁlter encompasses CH bands.
__label__positive Hence, 2P stars exhibit fainter Umagnitudes and redder U Bcolors than 1P stars as a result of their enhanced nitrogen and depleted carbon abundances [19,42].
__label__positive The Strömgren c1index, originally designed to measure the Balmer discontinuity strength, is also an efﬁcient tool to detect star-to-star vari- ations in the strength of the CN molecular bands.
__label__positive Since the 1990s, it has been used for detecting multiple populations along with the RGB of various GCs [ 14,43,44].
__label__positive The set of photometric indices designed by Jae-Woo Lee and collaborators is another outstanding tool to detect multiple populations along the RGB (e.g., [45–47]).
__label__positive Stellar models predict that MS and RGB stars with different helium contents but the same luminosity have different effective temperatures.
__label__positive Hence, helium-rich stars exhibit bluer colors than stars with pristine helium abundance (Y0.25) as a result of their hotter effective temperatures (e.g., [ 48,49]).
__label__positive The pho- tometric signature of helium is due to the fact that helium alters the stellar struc- ture, while the emerging ﬂux is rather negligible [ 50].
__label__positive Early discoveries of split MSs in GCs with large internal helium variations were based on CMDs made with the mF555W mF814W and mF475W mF814W colors [ 13,16–18,51].
__label__positive Wider color baselines, such as mF275W mF814W , are more sensitive to helium variations than colors made with optical ﬁlters, thus allowing for disentangling stellar populations with small helium differences of DY = 0.01 or less [52].
__label__positive • Near-Infrared photometry is an efﬁcient tool to identify multiple populations of M dwarfs.
__label__positive The F110W and F160W ﬁlters of the WFC3/NIR camera onboard HST , which
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 4 of 41 are similar to the J and H bands, are the most widely used ﬁlters.
__label__positive Indeed, the F160W band is heavily affected by absorption from various molecules that contain oxygen, including H 2O, while F110W photometry is poorly affected by the oxygen abundance.
__label__positive Since 2P stars are oxygen-depleted, they have brighter mF160W magnitudes and redder mF110W mF160W colors than the 1P [23,33].
__label__positive • Two-color diagrams and pseudo color-magnitude diagrams.
__label__positive Two-color diagrams in- volving far-UV , UV , and optical ﬁlters are widely used to identify multiple populations along different evolutionary phases.
__label__positive The most used ones are the mF275W mF336W vs.mF336W mF438W .
__label__positive F225W, F343N, and F410M bands often substitute for one or more traditional ﬁlters.
__label__positive The reason why these ﬁlters are efﬁcient tools to identify MPs in GCs is that F275W (or F225W) and F336W (or F343N) passbands include OH and NH molecular bands, while F438W (or F410M) comprises CN and CH bands.
__label__positive As a consequence, 1P stars, which are O-rich and C-rich but N-poor, are relatively bright in F336W but are fainter than 2P stars in F275W and F438W [22,53].
__label__positive To investigate multiple populations along all evolutionary sequences together, Milone et al.
__label__positive [53] combined these colors to deﬁne the pseudo-colors CF275W,F336W,F438W= (mF275W mF336W ) (mF336W mF438W ).
__label__positive ThemF336W mF438W vs.mF438W mF814W two-color diagram and the CF336W,F438W,F814W = (mF336W mF438W ) (mF438W mF814W ) pseudo-color, together with the analogous di- gram made with ground-based photometry in U, B, and I bands are also widely used to investigate multiple populations in GCs [22,53,54].
__label__positive • The photometric diagram dubbed a Chromosome Map (ChM) is a pseudo-two-color diagram that is built for MS, RGB, or AGB, separately [ 24,55].
__label__positive The main difference with a simple two-color diagram is that the sequences of MS, RGB, or AGB stars are verticalized in both dimensions in such a way that stars of each stellar population are clustered in a small area of the ChM.
__label__positive The ChM is derived from colors that are sensitive to the speciﬁc composition of GC stars with the aim of maximizing the sepa- ration among the distinct populations.
__label__positive The traditional ChMs are built by combining themF275W mF814W color, which is mostly sensitive to helium variations, with the CF275W,F336W,F814W , which is mainly a proxy of nitrogen abundance1.
__label__positive Other ChMs are constructed from colors of M dwarfs made with photometry in optical (e.g., mF606W mF814W ) and NIR bands (e.g., mF110W mF160W ) to disentangle stellar populations with different oxygen abundances [ 57].
__label__positive Recently, a ChM that includes photometry in the F280N band has been introduced and is sensitive to the magnesium content of stellar populations [58].
__label__positive [59] allows for properly comparing the maps of different GCs.
__label__positive It differs from the ChM because its pseudo-color extension does not depend on cluster metallicity.
__label__positive The diagrams derived from integrated CF275W,F336W,F438W pseudo-color and the mF275W mF814W color are valuable tools to detect the multiple population properties from GC integrated light [ 60].
__label__positive Work based on 56 Galactic GCs, where multiple populations are widely studied, revealed that after the dependence from metallicity is removed, the color residuals depend on the maximum internal helium variation within GCs and on the fraction of 2P stars.
__label__positive Hence, this tool has the potential to extend the investigation of multiple populations outside the local group [60].
__label__positive Some photometric diagrams that allow disentangling multiple populations in GCs are plotted in Figure 1 for 47 Tucanae [ 23,61].
__label__positive These include the mF814W vs.CF275W,F343N,F438W and theIvs.CU,B,I diagrams (upper panels), the mF343N mF435W vs.mF275W mF343N two-color diagrams that we show for SGB and HB stars (middle panels) and the DCF275W,F343N,F435W vs.DF275W,F814W ChMs of RGB, AGB, and MS stars (bottom panels).

__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 6 of 41 As an example of methods to identify multiple populations among M dwarfs, we use the catalogs by Milone et al.
__label__positive [33] to plot various photometric diagrams of 47 Tucanae in Figure 2.
__label__positive Speciﬁcally, we show the deep mF814W vs.mF606W  mF814W CMD (panel a) and highlight the region of the MS where multiple populations are more evident (panel b).
__label__positive In these diagrams, the MS broadening is much wider than the spread due to observational errors alone, thus revealing the multiple populations.
__label__positive The mF160W vs.mF110W mF160W CMD is illustrated in panel d and reveals the effectiveness of NIR photometry to identify multiple populations among M dwarfs.
__label__positive While stars brighter than the knee2around mF160W20.2 span a narrow color range, the MS breadth suddenly increases from the MS knee toward faint magnitudes.
__label__positive A gradient in the mF110W mF160W color distribution is also evident, with the majority of stars having blue colors and a tail of red MS stars.
__label__positive Finally, the DF110W,F160W vs.DF606W,F814W ChM of M dwarfs and the corresponding Hess diagram are plotted in panels c1 and c2 of Figure 2.
__label__positive The ChM reveals an extended 1P sequence composed of stars withDF110W,F160W .0.25 and three main groups of 2P stars in close analogy with what is observed along the upper MS and the RGB.

__label__positive Classiﬁcation of Globular Clusters As we will widely discuss through this review, various properties of multiple pop- ulations, such as the the chemical compositions (Section 5), the fractions of 1P and 2P stars, the number of distinct sub-populations that compose the 1P and 2P (see Section 6 ), spatial distributions (Section 6.6), and kinematics (Section 6.7) dramatically change from one cluster to another.
__label__positive With this in mind, we identify two distinct classiﬁcations of GCs that we will use throughout the paper.
__label__positive • GCs are grouped into two main groups of Type I and Type II based on the distribution of stars in the ChM and/or on star-to-star heavy-element variations [ 24,64].
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 7 of 41 GCs, which comprise the majority of Galactic GCs, host two main populations of 1P and 2P stars with similar metallicity but different abundances of some light elements.
__label__positive The second group of GCs, dubbed Type II GCs, comprises about 15–20% of the Milky Way GCs studied through the ChM.
__label__positive Type II GCs are characterized by at least one of these properties: 1.
__label__positive In addition to ChM composed of 1P and 2P stars, they show at least an additional sequence running on the red side of the main map [24].
__label__positive Stars on the faint SGB evolve into a distinct RGB sequence with redder U Icolors than the remaining RGB stars (hereafter red-RGB) [24,65,66].
__label__positive At odds with the majority of GCs, they exhibit signiﬁcant variation in metallicity, due to iron variation, overall C +N+O, variations, or both (e.g., [20,28,67–75]).
__label__positive These three characteristics could be physically connected to each other as observed in some Type II GCs.
__label__positive As an example of this classiﬁcation, we compare in Figure 3 the ChMs of the Type I GC NGC 6723 and the Type II GC NGC 1851 [24].
__label__positive • Another classiﬁcation is based on the color distance between the RGB and the reddest part of the HB ([ 76],L1).
__label__positive By adopting the names of the prototype GCs, we deﬁne M3-like those GCs with L1<0.35, while the remaining clusters are named M13-like GCs.
__label__positive The HB of M3-like is well populated on the red side of the RR Lyrae instability strip, whereas in M13-like GCs, stars redder than the RR Lyrae are very few [ 76,77].
__label__positive Other differences between these two groups of GCs comprise the evidence that (i) their SGBs have different slopes [ 78] and (ii) M3-like GCs exhibit less extended 1G ChM sequences than M13-like GCs with similar metallicities [ 79].
__label__positive As an example, Figure 4 compares the CMDs and the ChMs of the prototype GCs M3 and M13.

__label__positive This ﬁgure is derived by using photometry from Milone et al.
__label__positive Formation Scenarios In the past40 years, astronomers have developed many scenarios to explain the formation and evolution of multiple populations in GCs and proposed various candidate polluting stars to reproduce the chemical composition of 2P stars.
__label__positive Historically, the so called Evolutionary Hypothesis suggested that light-element varia- tions are the result of internal processes.
__label__positive Deep mixing of nuclear processed material from the interior into the surface layers would be the main force responsible for the abundance variations observed in RGB stars.
__label__positive However, this possibility has been ruled out by the discovery of star-to-star light-element variations among non-evolved MS stars which have negligible external convective zones [ 80,81].
__label__positive The evidence of abundance variations of some light elements such as Na, Al, and Mg indicates that these elements are not forged in the small mass that we observe today but are likely produced in the interior of more massive stars [82].
__label__positive Indeed, present-day stars are not hot enough to activate the Ne–Na and Mg–Al chains that are responsible for their production [83].
__label__positive In the following, we summarize some of the most appealing scenarios, while in the next sections we present the main observational challenges.
__label__positive Most scenarios can be classiﬁed into two main groups.
__label__positive Multi-generation scenarios predict that GCs experience a prolonged star formation with the occurrence of multiple star-formation bursts.
__label__positive In these scenarios, second-generation stars would form from the gas polluted by more massive 1P stars.
__label__positive This gas can mix with some original material from which the 1P formed (e.g., [29–32,84–88]).
__label__positive One of the most fascinating consequences of multi-generation scenarios is the so-called mass-budget phenomenon , which consists of the possibility that GCs were much more massive at formation by a factor of 5–20 (e.g., [ 89]).
__label__positive This is because only a small fraction of the initial mass of 1P stars is ejected with the composition required to generate 2P stars.
__label__positive To account for the the large amount of 2P stars observed in present-day GCs, the multi-
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 9 of 41 generation scenarios require that the progenitors of today’s GCs were substantially more massive than the present-day GCs and that they have lost most of their initial 1P into the ﬁeld.
__label__positive A consequence is that GCs would provide a signiﬁcant contribution to the assembly of the Galactic halo and, to less extent, of the Bulge (e.g., [ 5,90], and references therein).
__label__positive Clearly, such massive proto-GCs may have contributed to the cosmic reionization [5,91,92].
__label__positive Alternative scenarios suggest that all GC stars are coeval, and the peculiar chem- ical composition of 2P raises from accretion phenomena that occur during the pre-MS phase [34,35] .
__label__positive We summarize in the following some of the most popular scenario for the origin of multiple populations.
__label__positive We will emphasize the main observational challenges to these scenarios.
__label__positive The Asymptotic Giant Branch Scenario Since the 1980s, it has been suggested that the chemical anomalies in GCs arose from intermediate-mass (between 3–4 and8M) stars during their asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolution [ 29,30,93].
__label__positive These stars experience the so-called hot bottom burning process in which their surface convective envelope reaches deep enough that the temperature exceeds30–40 MK.
__label__positive Such temperatures are hot enough to allow nuclear burning to take place, resulting in efﬁcient p-capture nuclear processing.
__label__positive The AGB scenario predicts that GCs experience a major star formation event that leads to the formation of 1P stars.
__label__positive The intra-cluster medium is then cleaned by the feedback from SNe explosions so that virtually all material enhanced in metals is lost by the proto- GC.
__label__positive When intermediate-age stars experience the AGB phase, their low-velocity ejecta (10 km/s ) are retained within the cluster potential well.
__label__positive Then, second-generation stars form in the cluster center, where the AGB ejecta together with pristine material accumulate via cooling-ﬂow.
__label__positive Dilution with gas sharing the same chemical composition as 1P stars is a crucial ingredient for the AGB scenario, which allows for reproducing the O–Na anticorrelations observed in GCs.
__label__positive In this scenario, the interaction with the Galaxy, together with the expansion of the cluster external regions associated with 1P SNe, is responsible for the loss of a large fraction of GC stars during the early phases of its formation.
__label__positive Early mass loss would mostly affect 1P stars, whereas the 2P stars, which are initially clustered in the GC center, are largely retained within the proto-cluster [31,87,94].
__label__positive Fast-Rotating Massive Star Scenario In this scenario, the products of hot hydrogen burning are generated in the core of massive stars that rotate near the break-up limit.
__label__positive The polluted material is brought up to the stellar surface as a result of rotation-induced mixing, which is responsible for a nearly full mixing of the gas in the star.
__label__positive These fast-rotating massive stars (FRMSs) lose mass through slow mechanical equatorial winds and eject the polluted material in their surrounding discs, where the formation of 2P stars occur.
__label__positive To better reproduce the observed chemical composition of 2P stars, the ashes of the FRMSs that form the 2P are diluted with the gas left over from the formation of 1P stars [86,95,96].
__label__positive [84], the authors proposed massive binaries as sources of the polluted material from which the 2P stars are eventually formed.
__label__positive To investigate this possibility, they computed the evolution of a 20 Mstar interacting with a 15 Mcompanion.
__label__positive This binary system sheds almost the entire envelope of the primary star, which corresponds to about 10 solar masses of processed material.
__label__positive Such stellar ejecta, which share the same abundance patterns of He, C, N, O, Na, and Al as observed in GCs, have slow velocities so that they remain within the potential well of the proto-GC.
__label__positive In this scenario, second stellar generations form from subsequent star-formation episodes involving polluted material diluted with pristine gas.
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 10 of 41 Massive interacting binaries, together with fast-rotating massive stars, are also respon- sible for the chemical composition of 2P stars in the early disc accretion scenario .
__label__positive In this scenario, the enriched material released by interacting massive binaries and FRMSs is ac- creted on the protoplanetary discs of pre-main sequence stars and ultimately on the young stars [ 34].
__label__positive At odds with the original scenarios by de Mink et al.
__label__positive [96] , this scenario does not imply multiple episodes of star formation.
__label__positive Multiple Stellar Populations as a Case of Cooling Recently, Renzini et al.
__label__positive [88] proposed that most GCs formed inside pre-galactic dwarfs, in an epoch when the main body of the Milky Way was not yet formed.
__label__positive The conditions for generating multiple populations also occurred during the Galactic Bulge formation in metal-rich GCs.
__label__positive However, such conditions were rarer in the Bulge than in the dwarfs.
__label__positive Since 2P stars of most GCs share similar abundances of heavy elements as 1P stars, the material from which 2P stars form must not be polluted by the heavy elements ejected by supernovae.
__label__positive To avoid such kind of contamination, Renzini and collaborators suggested that the most massive stars would sink into black holes (see also [86] ).
__label__positive Stars more massive than a certain threshold ( 20–40M) would avoid the supernovae phase, thus suppressing most of the star formation feedback shortly after the formation of the ﬁrst generation GC stars and for a period of 5–10 Myr.
__label__positive The main implication of suppressing star formation feedback is a runaway star forma- tion, where the residual gas, together with the binary star ejecta, keeps forming stars until supernovae begin.
__label__positive Hence, the CNO/ p-capture materials, which are ejected by massive binaries from previous generations during the common envelope phase, are responsible for the chemical composition of 2P stars.
__label__positive Intriguingly, this scenario is similar to the overcooling that, in the absence of feedback, would have turned all the baryons into stars in the early Universe [88].
__label__positive The Super-Massive-Star Scenarios Stars more massive than 103solar masses are considered by Denissenkov and Hartwick [32] as responsible for the pollution of the gas from which 2P stars formed.
__label__positive In this scenario, the massive cluster stars would first sink in the center as a result of dynamic friction and coalesce there, thus forming a super-massive star.
__label__positive Main-sequence stars with these masses are convective, and their luminosity can exceed the Eddington limit.
__label__positive Hence, they would lose a signiﬁcant amount of mass as a result of various instabilities and stellar winds.
__label__positive The mass lost by the super-massive stars, which is enriched in helium and in the products of CNO-cycling and p-capture reactions, then mixes with the original material, thus forming the second generation of stars.
__label__positive [35] proposed another scenario where super-massive stars are responsible for the chemical composition of 2P stars.
__label__positive Following the idea by Denissenkov and Hartwick, they suggest that due to gas accretion the proto-GC undergoes an adiabatic contraction and dramatically increases the star-collision rate.
__label__positive When the cluster reaches high density, this phenomenon leads to the formation of a super-massive star (SMS) via runaway collisions.
__label__positive Hence, at odds with the scenario by [ 32], Gieles and collaborators predict one star formation episode only, but some of the 1P stars are polluted by the super-massive star ejecta.
__label__positive The polluted material released by the SMS winds is then diluted with pristine gas and accreted onto the protostars, thus forming 2P stars.
__label__positive One of the main advantages of this scenario is that the SMS can accrete a rate of mass in stars that is comparable with its mass loss.
__label__positive Because of this rejuvenation treatment, the total amount of material ejected by the SMS can be an order of magnitude higher than the SMS maximum mass.
__label__positive Stellar Mergers Mergers of massive stars in initially binary-rich embedded proto-GCs have been re- cently considered as possibly responsible for the occurrence of multiple stellar populations in GCs [ 97].
__label__positive N-body modeling of very young clusters shows that a large fraction of more
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 11 of 41 than half of the massive stars ( M>30M) can merge within the ﬁrst ﬁve million years of cluster life.
__label__positive The polluted material ejected during the stellar merger can mix with the winds of the fast-rotating massive stars and supermassive stars that formed after mergers.
__label__positive In this scenario, the 2P stars form from residual embedding gas mixed with the gas polluted by merger-driven ejection/winds.
__label__positive Hence, multiple polluters contribute to the chemical composition of 2P stars.
__label__positive The Chemical Composition of Multiple Populations GC stars include two main groups of 1P and 2P stars with different chemical com- positions.
__label__positive 1P stars are indistinguishable from the ﬁeld, as they share similar chemical composition as ﬁeld stars with the same metallicity.
__label__positive They exhibit peculiar light-element abundances, which are uncommon for ﬁeld stars.
__label__positive We summarize in this section the chemical properties of stellar populations in GCs through the abundances of those elements that better characterize the multiple stellar population phenomenon in GCs.
__label__positive Helium Although helium is the second most abundant element in stars, spectroscopic estimates of helium abundances in GC stars are quite rare.
__label__positive The main challenge is that reliable helium estimates from photospheric spectral lines are only feasible for HB stars with effective temperatures between 8000 K and11,500 K [ 98,99].
__label__positive Colder stars do not have strong enough helium lines in the optical, while stars hotter than 11,500 K are affected by helium settling.
__label__positive Hence, the helium content of their atmospheres is not representative of the total helium abundance [100–102].
__label__positive Direct spectroscopic evidence of helium-enhanced stars in the GCs is provided by NLTE analysis of the photospheric helium lines at 5875.6 Åin 17 blue HB stars of NGC 2808 colder than 11,500 K.
__label__positive The results showed that stars in the studied HB segment have average helium content of Y 0.34.
__label__positive Hence, they are enhanced in helium-mass fraction by DY0.09 with respect to the primordial value [ 99].
__label__positive Evidence of extreme helium enhancement by more than DY0.15 is provided by the investigation of NIR chromospheric He lines in RGB stars of both NGC 2808 and wCentauri [103,104].
__label__positive Recently, multiband photometry has provided a major breakthrough in constraining the helium abundances of multiple populations in GCs.
__label__positive This method is based on the comparison of the observed colors of the distinct populations and colors derived from grids of synthetic spectra with appropriate chemical compositions [ 22,53].
__label__positive The magnitude differ- ences of the RGB bumps of 1P and 2P stars from multiband photometry are powerful tools to constrain their relative helium contents [ 56,105].
__label__positive Helium estimates are now available from homogeneous analysis of more than 70 GCs in the Milky Way and in the Magellanic Clouds [61,105–107].
__label__positive The helium difference between 2P and 1P stars is, on average, DY2P 1P0.01 in helium- mass fraction.
__label__positive The maximum internal helium variations range from less than DYmax0.01 to 0.18, with NGC 2419 being the GC with the largest internal helium variation [ 61,105,108].
__label__positive The helium content of 2P stars is a constraint for multiple population formation scenarios.
__label__positive The fast-rotating massive star scenario predicts that 2P stars have helium abundances between that of 1P stars and 0.8, whereas the maximum helium enhancement expected in the AGB scenario is about 0.36–0.38 [109–111].
__label__positive Helium variations strongly correlate with the mass of the host GC, with massive clusters typically hosting stars with extreme helium content [ 61,105].
__label__positive In addition, the helium content of multiple populations correlates with their abundances of N, Na, and Al and anticorrelate with C, O, and Mg [56,64].
__label__positive Lithium Results based on high-resolution spectroscopy reveal that 1P and 2P stars of some GCs, (M4, M12 and NGC 362) share the same lithium abundance [ 112–114], while some 2P stars of other clusters such as M5, NGC 1904, NGC 2808, NGC 6397, and NGC 6752 have lower lithium abundances than the 1P3.
__label__positive However, signiﬁcant lithium depletion is only associated with a minority fraction of 2P stars with extreme chemical composition [ 113,114,116–118].
__label__positive As a remarkable example, Li-poor stars of NGC 2808 comprise only those 2P stars with the highest helium content (Y 0.36), whereas the remaining 2P stars, including 2P stars with Y0.32, have the same lithium content as the 1P [64,114,119,120].
__label__positive Since lithium is characterized by low burning temperature ( 2.5106K), it would constrain the source of polluted material from which 2P stars formed.
__label__positive Massive polluters, such as massive binaries, supermassive stars, and fast-rotating massive stars, can only destroy lithium.
__label__positive In contrast, intermediate-mass AGB stars can activate the Cameron–Fowler mechanism during the hot bottom burning and produce lithium [ 121]4.
__label__positive Hence, the evidence that 2P stars either share the same lithium abundance as 1P stars or exhibit moderate lithium depletion supports the AGB scenario.
__label__positive Light Elements One of the main features of multiple populations is that 2P stars exhibit different content of some light elements compared to 1P stars.
__label__positive Similar elemental variations are observed among RGB stars and unevolved MS stars, thus indicating that such chemical variations are not due to stellar evolution.
__label__positive The most studied elements include: • Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Sodium.
__label__positive 2P stars are enhanced in N and Na and depleted in C and O compared to 1P stars.
__label__positive These elements depict well-deﬁned patterns such as the Na–O and C–N anticorrelations and Na–N and C–O correlations, which are ubiquitous features of GCs with multiple populations [6,122]5.
__label__positive Signiﬁcant Mg and Si variations are present in a restricted number of massive GCs only, and the spread in [Mg/Fe] is typically wider in low-metallicity clusters.
__label__positive In contrast, aluminum variations are observed in nearly all GCs with [Al/Fe] correlating with [Na/Fe] (e.g., [ 128,129]).
__label__positive GCs with internal variations in these elements exhibit an Mg–Al anticorrelation and an Si–Al correlation.
__label__positive In these clusters, 2P stars are depleted in Mg and enhanced in Al and Si with respect to the 1P .
__label__positive Internal variations in [K/Fe] have been detected in-only three massive GCs , namely NGC 2419, NGC 2808, and wCentauri [130–133].
__label__positive As an example, we show in Figure 5 some correlations involving C, N, O, Mg, Al, and Si for NGC 2808.
__label__positive The distribution of light elements among GC stars and the maximum internal vari- ation signiﬁcantly change from one cluster to another.
__label__positive Some clusters exhibit bimodal or discrete stellar distribution in the Na–O plane (e.g., M4 and NGC 6752, [ 19,44]), whereas the distribution of stars in other GCs seems continuous [ 128].
__label__positive Although such continuity seems in contrast with the discrete distribution of 1P and 2P stars along the ChM, the 1P stars identiﬁed on the ChM are O-rich and Na-poor, and 2P stars are oxygen-depleted and sodium enhanced.
__label__positive Since the various light elements are formed and destroyed at different temperatures, the chemical patterns summarized above provide information on the sites where these processes occurred.
__label__positive This ﬁgure shows the C–N, Na–O, Mg–Al anticorrelations and the Al–Si correlation for NGC 2808.
__label__positive [134] , whereas the remaining elements are taken from Carretta [119] and Carretta et al.
__label__positive The chemical patterns involving C, N, O, and Na may reﬂect the chemical composition that results from CNO-cycling and p-capture processes at high temperatures.
__label__positive In main- sequence stars, the conversion of carbon into nitrogen requires temperatures hotter than 10106K.
__label__positive The activation of the ON branch of the CNO cycle and the Ne–Na chain, which produces Na from Ne and is responsible for the Na–O anticorrelation, requires higher temperatures of more than 35106K [136].
__label__positive In contrast, the abundance ratio of Mg and Al would be associated with the nuclear reactions that occurs at high temperatures such as the24Mg (p g)-Al25, which requires about 70106K (e.g., [ 90,95]).
__label__positive Temperatures hotter than80106K are needed to produce silicon, whereas potassium variations are due to the Ar–K chain that occurs at extreme temperatures of more than 150106K [83,137].
__label__positive Given that stars of different masses reach different temperatures in their interiors, the chemical composition of 2P stars would constrain the nature of the stars that polluted the material from which they formed.
__label__positive As an example, the maximum temperature in fast-rotating massive stars and massive binaries would not exceed 65106K, thus challenging the possibility that they are the only sources responsible for the chemical composition of Mg-depleted stellar populations [ 32,87].
__label__positive The hot-bottom burning of AGB stars can span a wide range of temperatures up to more than 100 106K, thus allowing various processes, including O depletion and Na production and Al, Si, and K production.
__label__positive A challenge for the AGB scenario arises from the massive AGB stars, which would destroy Na, thus producing a correlation between Na and O instead of the observed anticorrelation.
__label__positive However, uncertainties on the cross sections of the reactions responsible for forging or destroying the various elements and the poor knowledge on the hot-bottom burning prevent us from ﬁrm conclusions (see discussion by [87,90]).
__label__positive Metallicity Variations in Globular Clusters Metallicity variations are commonly associated with stellar systems more massive than present-day GCs.
__label__positive For a long time, the homogeneity in metallicity has been considered one of the most distinctive traits of GCs (with the sole exception of wCentauri).
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 14 of 41 more massive systems, such as galaxies, have deeper potential wells required to retain the fast ejecta from Supernovae [6,127,138].
__label__positive Thanks to studies based on high-resolution spectroscopy and on the ChMs, in the past decade, we have realized that internal variations in the overall metallicity are not a peculiarity of wCentauri.
__label__positive Recently, the number of observations suggesting that metallicity spreads are quite a common phenomenon in GCs is becoming increasingly larger [61,66,68,69,71,72,75,139,140] .
__label__positive In this section, we discuss the two main phenomena that are as of now associated with differences in overall metallicity.
__label__positive The Chemical Inhomogeneity of 1P Stars One of the most exciting outcomes of the ChM analysis is the fact that the 1P sequence of the ChM of most GCs is intrinsically broad, and in some clusters, such as NGC 2808, it exhibits hints of bimodality [ 24,56].
__label__positive The same phenomenon is observed for red HB stars, where the sequence of 1P stars in the mF336W mF438W vs.mF275W mF336W two- color diagram is not consistent with a chemically homogeneous stellar population [ 141].
__label__positive The extended 1P sequence is not a peculiarity of RGB and red HB stars.
__label__positive The evidence of elongated 1P sequence among non-evolved MS stars is proof that the material from which 1P stars formed was not chemically homogeneous [79].
__label__positive The extended 1P sequence was tentatively associated with pure helium variations [56,61] without any significant variation in C, N, and O.
__label__positive However, such a conclusion is at odds with expectations from standard nucleosynthesis (see discussion by [ 61]).
__label__positive It would imply that helium inhomogeneities are the product of exotic phenomena that occurred in the early Universe [142].
__label__positive When high-resolution spectroscopy came into the picture, it revealed that iron vari- ations within the material that originated the 1P can be responsible for the extended 1P sequence of the ChM [ 59,64].
__label__positive [59] derived high-precision iron abundance determinations of 18 1P stars of NGC 3201 and detected a [Fe/H] spread of about 0.1 dex, with the iron abundance correlating with the DF275W,F814W pseudo-color of 1P stars.
__label__positive A similar conclusion that metallicity spread is responsible for the extended 1P sequences in the ChM in the GCs NGC 6362 and NGC 6838 comes from the distribution of SGB stars in the appropriate In pseudo-two-magnitude diagrams [79].
__label__positive It is possible to take advantage of the 1P F275W  F814W color extension of the RGB [24] to constrain the internal iron spread by assuming that metallicity spread is the only factor responsible for the color width of 1P stars.
__label__positive The internal variations in [Fe/H] range from less than 0.05 to 0.30 dex and mildly correlate with the mass and the metallic- ity of the host GC.
__label__positive The 1P metallicity variation mildly correlates with cluster metallicity.
__label__positive For a ﬁxed metallicity, 1P stars in M13-like GCs exhibit smaller iron variations than those of M3-like GCs [79].
__label__positive The evidence of metallicity variations within the interstellar medium from which proto-clusters were born would constrain the multiple population formation scenarios.
__label__positive The metallicity scatter among 1P stars provides a lower-limit to the the scatter initially present in the gas [ 143–145].
__label__positive Turbulent diffusion within a proto-cluster cloud should smooth out chemical inhomogeneities at the scale of the cloud in roughly a crossing time.
__label__positive Since the crossing time increases in low-density extended clouds, while decreasing in high-density turbulent clouds, the 1P metallicity scatter is indicative of both metallicity variation in the original gas and the diffusion efﬁciency during the cloud collapse [ 79].
__label__positive In this context, 1P stars of M13-like GCs would form in a denser environment than 1P stars of M3-like GCs.
__label__positive Another intriguing feature of the ChMs of NGC 6362 and NGC 6838, which are quite simple GCs in the context of multiple populations, is the fact that the DF275W,F814W ex- tensions of their 2P stars are narrower than those of 1P stars [ 79].
__label__positive Hence, the material from which the 2P originated has a more homogeneous iron content than the cloud that formed 1P stars.
__label__positive Qualitatively, these observations are consistent with a scenario where the 1P formed in a low-density cloud, where the high crossing time has reduced the mix- ing efﬁciency, whereas the 2P originated in a high-density environment, as suggested by
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 15 of 41 multi-generation scenarios.
__label__positive Clearly, this ﬁnding seriously challenges the scenarios for the formation of multiple populations that are based on accretion of material processed in massive 1P stars onto existing protostars [79].
__label__positive Further information on the origin of 2P stars would come from the relative iron contents of the distinct stellar populations.
__label__positive [146] , based on high-precision differential abundances of multiple stellar populations in NGC 6752, ﬁrst detected star-to-star metallicity variations, with the iron abundance increasing for 2P stars.
__label__positive The ChM analysis now has the potential of providing similar information for many clusters.
__label__positive [79] pointed out that the relative separation between 1P and 2P sequences in the ChM changes from one cluster to another (see Figures 3–7 from [ 24]).
__label__positive In some clusters (e.g., NGC 2808 and NGC 6981), the 2P sequences merge with the 1P at low values of DF275W,F814W ; the 2P stars of other clusters such as NGC 104 and NGC 5272 are distributed on the metal-intermediate and possibly the metal-rich side of the 1P sequence.
__label__positive If the DF275W,F814W value where 2P stars join the 1P is indicative of their relative iron abundance alone, 2P stars can be either enhanced or depleted in iron with respect to the 1P .
__label__positive Chemical Composition of Type II, ‘Anomalous’ GCs A more complex phenomenon associated with internal variations in metallicity is the presence of a genuine new class of ’anomalous’ GCs with variations in heavy elements among 2P stars.
__label__positive From a chemical perspective, these clusters constitute a well-deﬁned class of ‘anomalous’ GCs, with distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties than the other GCs.
__label__positive The discovery of anomalous GCs revealed how wCentauri is not unique in harboring stellar populations with different overall metal content.
__label__positive Although this massive GC has the most extreme variations in the heavy elements ever observed in this group, it perfectly ﬁts the qualitative chemical pattern characterizing this class of globulars.
__label__positive A typical feature of most Type II GCs is the over-enrichment in the elements pro- duced via slow neutron capture reactions ( s-elements, [ s/Fe]) in the stars also enhanced in metallicity [ 20,66,68,69].
__label__positive The degree of s-elements enrichment varies from cluster to cluster.
__label__positive As an example, M22 shows a more moderate variation in all the s-elements compared to other Type II GCs with similar metallicity, e.g., M2 and NGC 5286.
__label__positive However, there is no evidence of s-processed-based enrichment in the two less massive Type II GCs, NGC 6934 and NGC 1261, suggesting that enrichment in the s-elements is not a universal feature of these objects and that the metals and s-elements enrichment are not coupled with each other [70].
__label__positive The variations in [Fe/H] and [ s/Fe] are very likely due to polluters with different mass ranges, i.e., to high mass and low mass stars, respectively.
__label__positive A possibility is that in more massive proto-clusters, the star formation proceeded for longer times than in normal clusters, giving the possibility to low-mass AGB stars to contribute to the enrichment in s-elements of the proto-cluster.
__label__positive At the time these low-mass stars start to pollute the intra- cluster medium, material enriched from fast SNe, and previously expelled, may have had the time to fall back into the cluster [ 70].
__label__positive A similar scenario has been proposed by D’Antona et al.
__label__positive If not a coincidence, the fact that the two less massive Type II GCs do not show evidence for s-element enrichment may suggest that the latest star-formation event occurred before the low-mass AGBs had the time to pollute the intra-cluster medium, pointing toward a less-extended star-formation history [70].
__label__positive From a chemical perspective, this class of stellar systems sits in the middle between a genuine GC, the typical Type I GCs, and more massive systems such as dwarf galaxies whereby they share the enrichment in metallicity.
__label__positive An example of the hybrid nature of these objects is displayed in Figure 6, where we show chemical abundances for the Type II GC M22.
__label__positive The two groups of stars with different abundances of iron and s-process elements are selected from the left-panel plot, whereas the right panel clearly shows the Na–O anticorrelation, which is typically observed in GCs.
__label__positive A puzzling feature characterising several Type II GCs, including M2, M22, M54, wCentauri, NGC 1851, NGC 5286, NGC 6273,
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 16 of 41 and NGC 6934 is that light-element variations and Na–O anticorrelations are present in stars with different metallicity (e.g., [ 28,59,66–69,73–75,148,149]).
__label__positive This fact seriously challenges our understanding of the chemical evolution of these objects.
__label__positive (Upper panels ) Barium against iron (left) and sodium against oxygen abundance (right) for stars in the Type II GC, M22; s-rich/Fe-rich and s-poor/Fe-poor stars are represented with black and red symbols, respectively.
__label__positive Normalized spectrum of the star that is marked with large black circles in the upper panels.
__label__positive The black and red lines in the insets compare the spectra of the metal-poor and metal-rich star, respectively, (large symbols in the upper panels) centered around two FeI lines.
__label__positive Since these two stars share very similar stellar parameters, the fact that Fe lines differ signiﬁcantly is a signature of metallicity difference.
__label__positive The spectra and chemical abundance that we use to draw this Figure are taken from [28,69].
__label__positive Other well-studied Type II GCs include: • M54 , which is associated with the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal.
__label__positive The fact that this cluster is located in the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy and belongs to the class of Type II GCs corroborates the idea that Type II GCs are naked nuclei of dwarf galaxies.
__label__positive In- deed, when the Sagittarius will be entirely stripped off by tidal interactions with the Milky Way, M54 will be deprived of its surrounding galaxy and will be almost indistinguishable from the other Type II GCs.
__label__positive • The most massive Galactic GC, wCentauri , exhibits large variations in metallicity, s-process elements, and overall C +N+O content [ 138,148–150].
__label__positive Due to its extreme chemical composition, and retrograde orbit, wCentauri is considered by many to be the surviving nucleus of a dwarf galaxy [ 151], an hypothesis reinforced by the recent discovery of tidal debris [152].
__label__positive • Interestingly, the Type II GCs M2and NGC 1851 are surrounded by extended en- velopes [ 153–155], while Marino et al.
__label__positive [156] noticed that the chemical composition of stars in the stellar halo around NGC 1851 is compatible with a dwarf remnant.
__label__positive • Terzan 5 is the most metal-rich GC with metallicity variations.
__label__positive It hosts at least two main stellar populations with [Fe/H]    0.2 and [Fe/H]+0.3.
__label__positive Together with NGC 6388 , it is a Type II GC located in the Galactic Bulge.
__label__positive Due to its metal content, it has been suggested that it is the remnant of a building block of the Bulge [157–159].
__label__positive • The metal-poor GC M15 ([Fe/H]  2.4) hosts two groups of stars with the same iron abundance but different content of barium and europium, in contrast to most GCs that
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 17 of 41 have constant [Eu/Fe].
__label__positive Hence, the nucleosynthetic history seems dominated more by ther-process than material in solar system [ 160].
__label__positive Each group of r-poor and r-rich stars exhibit a distinct Na–O anticorrelation as observed for s-rich and s-poor stars of M22 and other Type II GCs.
__label__positive The red population of the ChM of M15 hosts the 5% only of the total number of stars [ 161], whereas the two groups of r-rich and r-poor stars have comparable numbers of stars.
__label__positive As a consequence, there is no correspondence between red RGB stars of the ChM and stars with different content of r-elements.
__label__positive The Properties of Multiple Populations Results by several authors have vividly revealed the complexity of the multiple population phenomenon, in terms of the number of stellar populations, their chemical properties, and cluster-to-cluster heterogeneity.
__label__positive A major step forward in depicting the main properties of the multiple populations comes from the analysis of a homogeneous sample of ChMs for 60 GCs.
__label__positive The recent surveys of GCs have revealed that multiple populations are present in most studied Galactic GCs [24,25].
__label__positive Remarkable examples of simple population Galactic GCs comprise Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7, which according to both spectroscopic studies and multiband photometry are consistent with simple populations [ 162–164].
__label__positive Additional candidate simple population GCs comprise AM1, Eridanus, Palomar 3, Palomar 4, Palomar 14, and Pyxis, as inferred from their HB morphology [76,165].
__label__positive While 2P stars are present in nearly all GCs, they are rare in the Milky Way ﬁeld, where they constitute only a few percent ( 1–3 %) of the ﬁeld stars in the Galactic Halo (e.g., [ 166,167]) and in the inner Galaxy [ 168].
__label__positive However, recent work suggests that at 1.5 kpc from the Milky Way center, 2P stars include 16.8+10.0  7.0% of the total halo mass.
__label__positive The fraction drops to 2.7+1.0  0.8% at 10 kpc [ 169].
__label__positive These stars are generally thought to be either former members of dissolved GCs or stars of existing GCs that are lost into the ﬁeld through interactions with the Milky Way (e.g., [ 170]).
__label__positive As an alternative, it has been also speculated that 2P stars are not a distinctive feature of GCs but also form in other stellar systems (e.g., [168]).
__label__positive GCs host different numbers of stellar populations, and the extension and morphology of the ChM changes from one cluster to another [ 24,106].
__label__positive Moreover, the number of distinct sub-populations ranges from 2 (as in NGC 6535) to more than 17 in wCentauri [ 24,171].
__label__positive The collection of ChMs plotted in Figure 7 highlights the variety of the multiple population phenomenon.
__label__positive The ChMs of most GCs are composed of two main clumps of 1P and 2P stars.
__label__positive Although a few stars often populate the region of the ChM between the clumps, 1P and 2P stars are typically associated with discrete stellar populations in contrast to a continuous stellar distribution.
__label__positive The distribution of 2P stars in the ChM changes from one cluster to another.
__label__positive In some GCs, such as NGC 2808, we observe distinct stellar clumps, whereas 2P stars of other clusters (e.g., NGC 5272) exhibit nearly continuous pseudo-color distributions.
__label__positive In contrast, stellar clumps among 1P stars are quite rare, with NGC 2808 being a possible exception.
__label__positive The dashed lines separate the bulk of 1P stars from the 2P .
__label__positive This ﬁgure illustrates the high degree of variety of the multiple population phenomenon.
__label__positive Although the multiple population phenomenon is characterized by a high degree of variety, multiple stellar populations share several common properties.
__label__positive In the following, we summarize the main relations between multiple populations and the properties of the host cluster and the parent galaxy.
__label__positive Moreover, we discuss the relation with stellar mass.
__label__positive Dependence on Cluster Mass Recent work has shown that the complexity of the multiple population phenomenon increases with the mass of the host GC.
__label__positive The dependence on cluster mass involves the relative numbers of 1P and 2P stars as well as the internal chemical variations.
__label__positive • In Milky Way GCs, the fraction of 2P stars ranges from less than 40%, in low-mass clusters such as NGC 6362 to more than 90% in the most massive GC, wCentauri.
__label__positive As shown in the left panel of Figure 8, the fraction of 1P stars signiﬁcantly anticorrelates with present-day cluster mass, and the signiﬁcance of the anticorrelation increases when initial mass estimates are considered [ 24,106,141].
__label__positive Additional relations involving the fraction of 1P stars comprise (i) a strong anticorrelation with the present-day mass of the 2P but (ii) a mild anticorrelation with the present-day mass of 1P stars [106].
__label__positive • The internal variations in some light elements also depend on cluster mass (right panels of Figure 8).
__label__positive As an example, the CF275W,F336W,F438W andCF336W,F438W,F814W RGB widths, which are proxies of nitrogen abundance, correlate with cluster mass [ 24,164], in close analogy with what is observed for the mF110W mF160W color width of the MS below the knee [ 33], which is indicative of oxygen internal variations.
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 19 of 41 the maximum internal variation of helium strongly correlates with cluster mass (right panel of Figure 8, [61]).
__label__positive Fraction of 1P stars ( left) and maximum internal mass-fraction helium variation (right ) as a function of the present-day mass of the host GC.
__label__positive Gray and orange symbols rep- resent Galactic and Magellanic-Cloud GCs, respectively.
__label__positive The gray and orange lines plotted in the left panels are the best-fit straight lines for the groups of GC with the same color.
__label__positive Masses are from Baumgardt and Hilker [172] ; fraction of 1P stars and helium abundances are taken from Milone et al.
__label__positive Type II GCs are among the most massive GCs of the Galaxy, thus suggesting that high cluster mass is required to generate their metal-rich stellar populations [ 66,174].
__label__positive Clusters with metallicity variations are commonly associated with more massive stellar systems such as dwarf galaxies, which have been able to retain the fast ejecta from SNe.
__label__positive This idea is supported by the Type II GC M54, which is located in the nucleus of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
__label__positive As illustrated in Figure 9, the role of the total mass in the evolution of this class of objects is corroborated by the correlation between the present-day mass and the additional iron locked in the stellar populations enhanced in metals.
__label__positive The latter corresponds to the difference in iron mass fraction between red RGB and blue RGB stars multiplied by the fraction of mass in the stellar populations associated with the red RGB [ 70,175].
__label__positive Interestingly, low-mass Type II GCs exhibit homogeneous content of s-process elements, thus suggesting a mass threshold for the occurrence of the s-enrichment.
__label__positive Logarithm of the additional iron included in the metal richer stellar populations as a function of the logarithm present-day GC masses.
__label__positive Dependence on Cluster Orbit Despite the strong correlation between the fraction of 1P stars and cluster mass, it is worth noticing second-order dependence with the GC orbit.
__label__positive Galactic GCs with large perigalactic radii host, on average, larger fractions of 1P stars than clusters with small perigalactic radii and similar present-day masses [ 106,108].
__label__positive In addition, as shown in the left panel of Figure 8, the LMC and SMC clusters host larger fractions of 1P stars than Milky Way GCs with similar masses [106].
__label__positive The dependence on cluster orbit [ 106,108] can be combined with the four relations discussed in Section 6.1 to constrain the evolution of multiple populations.
__label__positive Speciﬁcally, we consider: (i) the mild anticorrelation between the fraction of 1P stars and the total present-day mass of 1P stars, together with the anticorrelations between the fraction of 1P stars and (ii) the present-day GC mass, (iii) the initial GC mass, and (iv) the present-day total mass of 2P stars [ 106].
__label__positive These relations may represent the smoking gun that GCs preferentially lose 1P stars.
__label__positive Indeed, they are expected in a scenario where the fraction of 1P stars ranges from 0.6 to 0.8 at cluster formation and decreases with increasing cluster mass.
__label__positive In this scenario, the GCs have lost a large fraction of their 1P stars but a smaller amount of 2P stars [106].
__label__positive Multiple Populations and Stellar Mass Very-low mass (VLM) stars of GCs are still poorly investigated in the context of multi- ple populations as they require high-precision NIR photometry of faint stars.
__label__positive Nevertheless, the comparison of the multiple population properties among stars of different masses may allow us to discriminate among the different formation scenarios.
__label__positive Pioneering work, based onHST photometry in the F110W and F160W bands of NIR/WFC3, provided the ﬁrst results on the mass functions (MFs) and the chemical compositions of VLM stars.
__label__positive • Deep HST photometry in NIR bands allowed disentangling the three distinct stellar populations of NGC 6752 below the MS knee and constraining their oxygen abun- dances.
__label__positive The discovery that the relative oxygen values of multiple populations among VLM stars and more massive ( 0.8M) RGB stars are consistent with each other suggests that the chemical composition of multiple populations does not depend on stellar mass [176].
__label__positive A similar conclusion is provided for 1P and 2P stars of M4 [177].
__label__positive [33] ﬁrst derived the MFs of the multiple populations of NGC 2808 and M4 over the mass interval between 0.25 and 0.80M.
__label__positive The conclusion is that 1P and 2P stars share similar MFs and that the relative numbers of 1P and 2P stars are constant over the analyzed mass interval.
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 21 of 41 NGC 6752, where the fractions of stars in the three populations do not change with cluster mass [176].
__label__positive Results on the oxygen variations among stars of different masses would constrain the scenarios for the formation of multiple populations.
__label__positive Indeed, if accretion of polluted material onto pre-existing stars is the mechanism responsible for the origin of 2P stars [ 34,84], the chemical composition of 2P stars could depend on stellar mass.
__label__positive As an example, by assuming Bondy–Hoyle–Littleton accretion, the amount of accreted material is proportional to the square of the stellar mass.
__label__positive Hence, VLM stars would accrete a smaller amount of polluted gas and exhibit smaller oxygen variations than RGB and bright MS stars.
__label__positive The evidence that stellar populations exhibit the same present-day MFs is consistent with a scenario where they originated with similar initial mass functions (IMFs) [ 170].
__label__positive If the distinct stellar populations formed in environments with different densities, such that 2P stars originated in the dense and compact regions of the cluster center (e.g., [ 94,178]), results on NGC 6752, M4 and NGC 2808 may indicate that the IMF does not signiﬁcantly depend on the density in the formation environment [33].
__label__positive Multiple Populations along the Asymptotic Giant Branch Photometric surveys of multiple populations reveal that the fraction of 1P and 2P stars along the AGB of several GCs is comparable with that observed along the RGB and the MS [ 26], thus confirming previous results based on both photometry and spectroscopy [56,179–183] .
__label__positive In contrast, the AGB sequences of at least 25% of the studied GCs host lower fractions of 2P stars than the RGBs [ 164].
__label__positive The most studied cases include NGC 6752, NGC 6266, and NGC 2808 [26,179,184–186] , where only the 2P stars with the most extreme chemical composition seem to skip the AGB phase.
__label__positive Noticeably, a common feature of NGC 6752, NGC 6266, and NGC 2808 is the presence of 2P stars that are highly enhanced in helium–mass fraction up to DY0.04,0.07 and0.12, respectively [53,55,187].
__label__positive These findings support the prediction from stellar evolution that He-rich stars of old stellar populations may avoid the AGB phase and evolve as AGB-manque stars [109,188–190] .
__label__positive Indeed, extreme 2P stars are helium enhanced with respect to the remaining GC stars.
__label__positive During the HB phases, their envelope masses could be too small so that they do not evolve towards the Hayashi track as the remaining AGB stars, but rather toward the white-dwarf-cooling sequence.
__label__positive However, simulated CMDs show that helium variations alone seem not enough to explain the lack of AGB stars with extreme chemical composition.
__label__positive Hence, the presence of AGB-manque stars in these clusters may imply that their 2P stars lose more mass in the RGB phase compared to the 1P [26,184,186].
__label__positive Another unexpected ﬁnding concerns six Type II GCs, namely wCentauri, NGC 1851, NGC 5286, NGC 6388, NGC 6656, and NGC 6715, where Lagioia et al.
__label__positive [26] were able to disentangle the AGB stars of the metal-poor and metal-rich populations.
__label__positive Intriguingly, the AGB to RGB ratios are signiﬁcantly smaller among metal-enhanced stars than in metal-poor stars [26].
__label__positive The physical reasons responsible for this phenomenon are still unknown.
__label__positive Binaries and Multiple Populations Early attempts to infer the incidence of binaries among 1P and 2P stars come from radial velocities and suggest a larger incidence of 1P binaries.
__label__positive However, these conclusions come from a small number of stars.
__label__positive Based on 21 spectroscopic binaries, Lucatello et al.
__label__positive [191] concluded that the fraction of binaries among 1P stars is 4.1 1.7 times larger than that of 2P stars.
__label__positive [192] detected that only 1 out 12 spectroscopic binaries belongs to the 2P of the GC NGC 6362.
__label__positive This corresponds to a fraction of binaries in the 1P and 2P populations equal to 4.7 1.4% and 0.70.7%, respectively.
__label__positive While spectroscopic studies analyzed the external cluster regions, cluster central regions have been investigated through multiband HST photometry of four GCs.
__label__positive Results reveal that NGC 288, NGC 6352, and NGC 6362 show similar incidence of binaries in the innermost cluster regions.
__label__positive In contrast, the 1P binary incidence in the central region of M4 is about three times larger than the 2P incidence [193].
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 22 of 41 The incidence of binaries among multiple populations may provide constraints on the formation scenarios of multiple populations and their long-term evolution.
__label__positive Indeed, the rates of binary disruption and the properties of surviving binaries depend on the stellar density [ 194–197].
__label__positive The observational ﬁndings support the outcomes of simulations where 2P stars formed in the high-density innermost cluster regions.
__label__positive These simulations predict signiﬁcant differences in the global 1P and 2P incidences and in the local values in the clusters’ outer regions but similar incidences in the inner regions.
__label__positive Spatial Distribution of Multiple Populations The spatial distribution of stellar populations in GCs would provide fossil records of their initial conﬁgurations, thus constraining the scenarios for the formation of multiple populations [198].
__label__positive The distinctive feature of several Type I GCs (e.g., 47 Tucanae, NGC 2808, M3, NGC 5927) is that 2P stars are more centrally concentrated than the 1P [ 22,45,141,199,200].
__label__positive On the other hand, 1P and 2P stars of other clusters (e.g., NGC 6752, NGC 6362, M5, NGC 6366, NGC 6838 among the others) share similar radial distributions [ 45,141,176,192]6.
__label__positive The spatial distributions of 1P and 2P stars are ﬁtted with ellipses that exhibit either the same shapes or different ellipticities [201].
__label__positive These ﬁndings are consistent with the scenarios where 2P stars are born in the cluster center and are more centrally concentrated than the 1P at the formation.
__label__positive Clearly, those clusters with centrally concentrated 2P stars still keep the memory of the initial distribution of their multiple populations, whereas 1P and 2P stars of other GCs are fully mixed due to dynamic evolution [198].
__label__positive Spatial distributions are poorly studied in Type II GCs with wCentauri and M22 being remarkable exceptions.
__label__positive Similarly to what is observed in several Type-I GCs, the stellar populations with extreme abundances of helium and nitrogen are more centrally concentrated than stars with low contents of these elements [ 202,203].
__label__positive Stars with different iron abundances of both wCentauri and M22 share similar ellipticities, while N-rich stars are more ﬂattened than N-poor stars.
__label__positive This fact is consistent with a scenario where distinct processes are responsible for the enrichment in iron and in p-capture elements s [204].
__label__positive Internal Kinematics of Multiple Populations As with the spatial distribution, the present-day kinematics of cluster stars, such as rotation and velocity dispersion, can also be related to the initial conﬁguration of the proto GC (e.g., [198,205,206]).
__label__positive The synergy of high-precision proper motions from HST multi-epoch images and from Gaia data releases [ 207,208] and radial velocities have allowed us to investigate the internal motions of the distinct stellar populations of GCs.
__label__positive The result is that 2P stars of some GCs exhibit more radially anisotropic velocity distributions than the 1P [ 201,209–212].
__label__positive These ﬁndings are consistent with a scenario where 2P stars are initially more centrally concentrated compared to 1P stars and diffuse toward the cluster outskirts.
__label__positive In other clusters, both 1P and 2P stars exhibit isotropic velocity distributions [ 201], indicating that any initial difference in the kinematic properties of their 1P and 2P stars, if present, has been erased by dynamical processes.
__label__positive Multiple Populations and Cluster Age Most Galactic GCs with multiple populations are ancient stellar systems, with ages older than11–12 Gyr (e.g., [ 3,78]).
__label__positive In contrast, all Galactic open clusters, which are much younger than GCs, are chemically homogeneous [ 213].
__label__positive The evidence that open clusters are consistent with simple stellar populations could indicate that old and young star clusters have originated with different mechanisms and that the formation of multiple populations is only possible at high redshifts.
__label__positive In the past few years, the possibility that only old GCs host multiple populations has been challenged by the discovery of stars with different nitrogen abundances in LMC
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 23 of 41 and SMC intermediate-age clusters (ages of 2–10 Gyr).
__label__positive In contrast, there is no clear evidence of multiple populations in clusters younger than 2 Gyr (e.g., [ 106,214–216]), with NGC 1978 being the youngest cluster with robust evidence of multiple populations [141,216,217] .
__label__positive These results have suggested the occurrence of an age threshold for the onset of multiple populations [216,218].
__label__positive Due to observational limits of present-day facilities, the multiple populations of young LMC and SMC clusters have been properly studied in RGB and red-clump stars only.
__label__positive These stars are more massive than 1.5–1.6M, which is approximately the mass at which magnetic breaking occurs [ 219].
__label__positive Hence, it has been speculated that multiple populations are due to some unidentiﬁed process operating only in low-mass stars [216,218].
__label__positive The amount of star-to-star nitrogen variation has been used as a diagnostic to further investigate the dependence between multiple populations and cluster age.
__label__positive Although the maximum nitrogen spread in intermediate-age Magellanic-Cloud Clusters is comparable with that of many Galactic GCs, the nitrogen variations within clusters younger than 10 Myr are, on average, smaller than those observed in old GCs [ 164].
__label__positive Moreover, for a ﬁxed cluster mass, the fractions of 2P stars in intermediate-age clusters are typically smaller than those of ancient GCs [106,141].
__label__positive However, it should be noticed that the most massive clusters younger than 2 Gyr have initial masses of 105.3M, which are only slightly higher than the possible mass threshold for the occurrence of multiple populations [ 106].
__label__positive The uncertainty associated with the estimates of initial cluster masses [ 172] together with the evidence that both the internal nitrogen variations depend on cluster mass and on the environment prevents us from any conclusion on the fact that cluster age affects the multiple population phenomenon.
__label__positive Multiple Populations and Their Parent Galaxy Multiple stellar populations are not a peculiarity of Galactic GCs but have been detected in star clusters of the Large and Small Magellanic Cloud [ 107,214,216,220,221], Fornax [222] , and in the Andromeda galaxy, M31 [ 223].
__label__positive Multiple populations in extragalac- tic GCs seems to share the same properties as in Milky-Way clusters with some possible exceptions.
__label__positive We also notice that neither the LMC and the SMC host Type II GCs, while these objects comprise about 17% of studied Milky-Way GCs.
__label__positive Moreover, about half of the known Type II GCs have been associated with a single accretion event.
__label__positive This conclusion comes from the fact that, based on Gaia cluster motions [ 224], 7, possibly 8, out of 14 known Type II GCs appear clustered in a distinct region of the integral of motions (IOM) space.
__label__positive Satellites may appear as clumps in the IOM space when they are accreted by the Milky Way, and such clumps would survive for more than a Hubble time.
__label__positive Hence, the clustering of several Type II GCs in the IOM space is a strong indication that they are associated with accreted satellites.
__label__positive Another approach to investigate the role of the parent galaxy on the multiple popula- tion phenomenon consists of comparing the multiple populations of GCs formed in situ, those that are the products of a merging process and the GCs that are not associated with any parent stellar stream and are characterized by either high or low energy ( see [224] , for accurate links of most Galactic GCs with a variety of progenitor galaxies)7.
__label__positive In these three different groups of GCs, the fractions of 1P stars and the mass of the host GCs follow similar trends, thus indicating that there is no evidence of any dependence of the present-day population ratio in GCs on the progenitor system [106].
__label__positive It is worth noting that most candidate simple population GCs are either high-energy clusters, where the progenitor galaxy is not known, or have been associated with the progenitor of the Helmi stream [ 227] and the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal.
__label__positive Based on these results, it is tempting to speculate that simple population GCs are low-mass clusters that formed in the environment of dwarf galaxies [106].
__label__positive The Second-Parameter Problem of the Horizontal Branch Morphology The recent discoveries of multiple populations in GCs allow us to shed some light on the long-held problem of the HB morphology in GCs.
__label__positive Stellar-evolution studies show that for ﬁxed age and helium abundance, metal-rich stars at the RGB tip are more massive and colder than stars with lower Z.
__label__positive Hence, they would reach lower effective temperatures and redder colors than metal-poor stars when approaching the HB.
__label__positive For this reason, metallicity is commonly considered the ﬁrst parameter governing HB morphology in GCs.
__label__positive The most metal-rich GCs only host red HBs, whereas metal-poor GCs typically host blue HBs.
__label__positive The second-parameter problem of GC HB morphology is based on the evidence that there are some GCs with similar metallicities but different HB shapes.
__label__positive Historically, several second parameters have been suggested as candidates, including cluster age, helium abundance, binarity, mass loss, and stellar rotation, but none of them fully reproduces the observations of GC HBs (e.g., [3]).
__label__positive The nearest GC, M4, can be considered the ‘Rosetta stone’ to link multiple populations and HB morphology in GCs.
__label__positive This cluster, which has been widely studied in the context of multiple populations (e.g., [ 180]), exhibits a bimodal HB, which is well-populated on both sides of the RR Lyrae instability strip.
__label__positive High-resolution spectroscopy of RGB stars has revealed two distinct stellar populations with different abundances of oxygen and sodium that populate two RGB sequences in the CMD [ 19].
__label__positive The direct evidence of a connection between multiple populations and the HB morphology is from a similar investigation of the HB.
__label__positive FLAMES@VLT spectra have shown that the blue HB is entirely composed of stars enhanced in sodium and depleted in oxygen, whereas red HB stars share the same chemical composition as the 1P [ 28].
__label__positive Today, the link between multiple populations and stars of different chemical compositions is a well-established fact and is observed in several GCs (e.g., [22,99,228–230]).
__label__positive The evidence that 1P and 2P stars populate distinct HB segments was initially entirely associated with their different helium abundances.
__label__positive Indeed, stars enhanced in helium evolve faster than stars with pristine helium content.
__label__positive In monometallic GCs, for ﬁxed age and RGB mass loss, they produce less-massive HB stars, which have hotter temperatures.
__label__positive As a consequence, 1P stars (with Y 0.25) would mainly populate the red HB portion, whereas the 2P stars, which are helium enhanced, have bluer colors (e.g., [ 48,231,232]).
__label__positive This prediction from theory seems supported by the strong correlation between the color extension of the HB and the maximum internal helium variation, inferred from RGB and MS stars [61].
__label__positive The fact that helium abundance determinations are now available from a large sample of GCs allows us to ﬁx the helium content of 1P and 2P stars along with the HB and constrain their mass losses [ 77,233].
__label__positive It resulted that 2P stars lose more mass than the 1P and that the enhanced mass loss of 2P stars, in addition to helium, is needed to explain the observed color extension of the HBs.
__label__positive These results on multiple populations may provide new insights on the long-held second-parameter problem of the HB morphology.
__label__positive Freeman and Norris [234] suggested that at least two parameters are needed to reproduce the HB of GCs.
__label__positive One of these should be a global parameter that varies from GC to GC and the other a non-global parameter that varies within the GC.
__label__positive Recent works show that the color separation between the reddest part of the HB and the RGB correlates with both cluster age and metallicity [ 3,76].
__label__positive In contrast, the color extension of the HB is reproduced by internal helium variations and enhanced mass loss for 2P stars [ 61,76,77].
__label__positive Hence, cluster age and metallicity are the best-candidate global parameters, while helium variations and mass loss are the non-global parameters of the HB morphology.
__label__positive The enhanced mass loss of 2P stars may indicate that they formed in high-density environments.
__label__positive [77,235] proposed a scenario where the accretion disks of pre- main-sequence 2P stars are disrupted at early stages by dynamic interactions in the dense cluster center.
__label__positive As a consequence, their cores exhibit faster rotation rates.
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 25 of 41 is delayed, and the duration of the red-giant phase is prolonged, which results in the mass loss increase.
__label__positive Moreover, the RGB mass loss difference between 2P stars with extreme chemical composition and 1P stars correlates with the mass of the host GC.
__label__positive However, for a ﬁxed mass, M13-like GCs typically lose more mass than the M3-like GCs.
__label__positive A possible interpretation is that 1P stars of M13-like GCs form in high-density environments.
__label__positive As an alternative, M13-like GCs have entirely lost their 1P stars [ 236], and the stars that we name 1P belong to the 2P .
__label__positive The Mass Loss Law for 1P Stars and Simple Population Clusters Studies on multiple populations have allowed us to identify 1P stars along the HB and RGB of GCs and constrain their mass loss, m.
__label__positive Results from 53 Galactic GCs show that the amount of integrated RGB mass loss and [Fe/H] that we observed both in simple population GCs and in 1P stars of multiple population GCs is described by the empirical relation: m= (0.090.01)[Fe/H] + ( 0.300.03)M (1) The tight correlation between mand [Fe/H] suggests that this mass loss does not depend on the multiple population phenomenon and is possibly a general property of Populations-II stars [77,165].
__label__positive The Extended Main Sequence T urn-Off Phenomenon Multiple sequences are not a peculiarity of the CMDs of old GCs.
__label__positive High-precision HST photometry revealed that the CMDs of star clusters younger than 2 Gyr are not consistent with simple isochrones (e.g., [56,237–239]).
__label__positive The two main differences are: • The extended MS turn off (eMSTO) is the most prominent feature indicating that the CMDs of young Magellanic-Cloud Clusters are not consistent with simple populations.
__label__positive The eMSTO is visible both in CMDs composed of optical ﬁlters alone and CMDs that comprise UV photometry.
__label__positive In contrast, other CMD sequences, such as the MS, RGB, and the AGB, are narrow and well-deﬁned, thus ruling out the possibility that the eMSTO is due to differential reddening or observational errors.
__label__positive As an example, we plot in Figure 10 the CMD of NGC 1846 and highlight its eMSTO in the inset.
__label__positive [237] and Mackey and Broby Nielsen [238] in the LMC clusters NGC 2173 and NGC 1846.
__label__positive It is a universal feature of Magellanic Cloud Clusters with ages between 20 Myr and2 Gyr [239–241].
__label__positive • In addition to the eMSTO, star clusters younger than 800 Myr exhibit split MSs , with the red MS hosting the majority of MS stars [ 242–244].
__label__positive In all clusters, the two MSs merge together for stellar masses smaller than 1.5–1.6M, which is the mass limit where MS stars would be magnetically braked [219].
__label__positive The main difference with old GCs with multiple populations is that star clusters younger than2 Gyr appear chemically homogeneous, and such a conclusion is based both on photometry [193,243,245,246] and on high-resolution spectroscopy [247].
__label__positive Spectroscopy of eMSTO stars shows direct detection of rapidly rotating stars [ 248].
__label__positive Fast rotators are preferentially distributed on the red side of the eMSTO, while slow rotators exhibit bluer colors [ 249,250].
__label__positive Similar analysis on MS stars reveals that the blue MS is composed of slow rotators, while the red MS hosts fast rotating stars [ 249,251].
__label__positive At odds with previous conclusion from photometry, spectroscopy provides evidence of more than two stellar populations with different rotation rates in the studied clusters.
__label__positive Further evidence for fast rotating stars is provided by the presence of Be stars in clusters younger than 2–300 Myr [ 252,253].
__label__positive Be stars have rotational velocities close to the breakout value and are characterized by partially ionised decretion disks.
__label__positive Due to their signiﬁcant H aemission, these stars are detected with photometric diagrams containing narrow-band ﬁlters centered on the H a.
__label__positive It results that Be stars comprise about half of the stars near the MSTO, and their fraction declines toward fainter magnitudes [ 61].
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 26 of 41 the large fraction of Be stars among the eMSTO, which is highlighted in Figure 10 for NGC 1850, corroborates the evidence that young clusters host conspicuous populations of fast-rotating stars.
__label__positive Further indirect evidence of multiple populations with different rotation rates is provided by the correlation between the age inferred by the eMSTO width and the cluster age [254].
__label__positive The split MSs and eMSTOs of Magellanic-Cloud Clusters share various properties: • Ubiquity.
__label__positive They are observed in all LMC and SMC clusters younger than 2 Gyr, for which appropriate datasets are available [ 240].
__label__positive The eMSTOs and split MSs, initially observed in Magellanic-Cloud Clusters, have been recently observed in several Galac- tic open clusters in the same age interval [ 249–251,255,256], thus suggesting that they are a general characteristic of young clusters.
__label__positive The relative numbers of stars in the blue and red MS depends on stellar mass.
__label__positive The fraction of blue MS stars declines from 30% among 4Mstars to15% for masses of 3M.
__label__positive The fraction of blue MS stars in SMC clusters seems smaller than that of LMC clusters, thus suggesting a possible dependence from either the host galaxy or cluster metallicity.
__label__positive However, the small number of studied SMC clusters with split MS prevents us from making a ﬁrm conclusion.
__label__positive For a ﬁxed interval of stellar masses, clusters with different masses and ages share a similar fraction of blue and red MS stars [240].

__label__positive The inset in the left panel shows a zoom of the CMD region around the eMSTO of NGC 1846, while the Be stars of NGC 1850 are marked with red symbols.
__label__positive In addition to the eMSTOs and the split MSs, young clusters have shown distinctive features in their CMDs.
__label__positive Dual clumps are interpreted as two main groups of red clump stars.
__label__positive One of them would avoid e degeneracy settling in their H-exhausted cores when He ignites.
__label__positive The second group would include slightly less massive stars that experience e-degeneracy before He ignition, thus reaching higher brightness [257,258].
__label__positive • Very recently, high-precision photometry in the F275W band of the WFC3/UVIS cam- era onboard HST resulted in a new ﬁnding.
__label__positive The 1.7 Gyr-old cluster NGC 1783 hosts a population of A-type stars that deﬁne a cloud of points with redder F275W  F438W and F336W F814W colors than the bulk of MS stars.
__label__positive When observed in optical di- agrams, such as the F555Wvs.F555W F814WCMD, these stars distribute along a sequence in the middle of the eMSTO (see Figure 11).
__label__positive We tentatively attribute the colors of these stars, dubbed UV-dim stars , to circumstellar dust [ 259].
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 27 of 41 investigation is needed to understand this new phenomenon and its possible relation with the multiple MSs and eMSTOs.

__label__positive The inset in the left panel shows a zoom of the CMD region around the eMSTO.
__label__positive (Panels ( b,c)) show the mF438W vs.mF275W mF438W andmF555W vs.mF555W mF814W , respectively.
__label__positive The Origin of eMSTOs and Split MSs Although early works have interpreted the eMSTO as the result of a prolonged star formation alone (e.g., [ 260–263]), it is now clear that stellar rotation plays a major rule in shaping the eMSTO as ﬁrst suggested by Bastian and de Mink [264] .
__label__positive Similarly, the split MS is consistent with multiple populations with different rotation rates.
__label__positive The blue MS is reproduced by a non-rotating isochrone, whereas an appropriate ﬁt of the red MS needs fast stellar rotations that are close to the critical rotational value [265].
__label__positive The main reason why stars with different rotation rates mimic an age spread in the CMD is the combined effect of gravity and limb darkening.
__label__positive Gravity darkening causes the star to appear cooler and dimmer when viewed equator-on as compared to pole-on.
__label__positive In addition, limb darkening, a phenomenon due to the optical thickness of the atmosphere toward the center and the outskirts of a star, may produce a spread in color and magnitude for turn-off stars.
__label__positive As a consequence of both effects, a star seen from pole–on will appear bluer and brighter (hence hotter and brighter) than it would be if seen equator–on.
__label__positive By assuming that the rotation axes have random orientations, the combined effect of limb darkening and gravity darkening would reproduce the observed eMSTOs [219,265,266].
__label__positive However, simulated CMDs that account for rotation do not fully reproduce the ob- served MSTOs [ 61,267].
__label__positive As a consequence, some authors suggested that at least some eMSTO clusters experienced prolonged star formation [ 268,269].
__label__positive Indeed, a mix of age variation and rotation provides a good match with the studied CMDs.
__label__positive In particular, if we assume that blue MS stars were slow rotators at formation, most blue MS stars would be younger than the bulk of cluster members.
__label__positive [270] the blue MS is composed of stars that were initially rapidly rotating but have later slowed down.
__label__positive The effect of ‘braking’ would reduce the apparent age differences of eMSTO, thus indicating that the age spread in eMSTO stars is entirely a manifestation of rotational stellar evolution.
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 28 of 41 From the observational side, the fact that color and magnitudes of MS and MSTO stars are very sensitive to stellar rotation makes it very challenging to understand whether young clusters host stars with different ages.
__label__positive An independent approach to disentangle between age and rotation exploits the turn-on, which is the feature of the CMD where the pre-MS reaches the MS [ 271].
__label__positive The recent investigation of the turn-on luminosity function of NGC 1818, a40 Myr old LMC cluster indicates a fast star formation with a duration of less than 8 Myrs.
__label__positive Such results deﬁnitively demonstrate that age variation plays a minor role, if any, in shaping the eMSTO [272].
__label__positive The origin of multiple stellar populations with different rotation rates is also contro- versial.
__label__positive [270] suggested that all stars are born as fast rotators and that some of them are braked during their MS lifetime due to interaction in binary systems.
__label__positive As an alternative, the different rotation velocities are imprinted in the early stages of cluster formation depending on the time life of proto-stellar discs in pre-MS stars.
__label__positive In this scenario, present-day fast rotators are the progeny of pre-MS stars with short-lived proto-stellar discs, whereas long removal times for proto-stellar discs would result into slow rotators [235,273].
__label__positive [274] proposed that blue MS stars are slow rotators formed from stellar mergers.
__label__positive In their scenario, stars gain mass through two channels: by disk accretion, which leads red MS stars to rapid rotation, or by binary merger, leading to the slow rotating blue MS stars.
__label__positive Towards the Understanding of the Multiple Population Phenomenon In this work, we have illustrated the main observational properties of multiple popula- tions in star clusters, together with some scenarios to explain their formation and evolution.
__label__positive Clearly, none of the proposed scenarios fully reproduces the observations, and further observational and theoretical efforts are needed to understand the multiple population phenomenon.
__label__positive In the following, we summarize some of the research topics that, in our opinion, could provide a signiﬁcant advance in shedding light on multiple populations.
__label__positive • Recently, the photometric diagram dubbed ChMs has revealed extended sequences of 1P stars, possibly indicating that the pristine material from which GC formed was not chemically homogeneous.
__label__positive The synergy of multiband photometry [ 56,61,79] and high- precision spectroscopy [ 64,146] will allow us to infer very precise chemical abundances for GC stars and constrain the tiny star-to-star elemental variations within each stellar population.
__label__positive Is metallicity variation the only factor responsible for the extended 1P sequences in every GC, as inferred from accurate photometric and spectroscopic studies of a few clusters [ 64,79]?
__label__positive Can we exclude that 1P stars exhibit internal helium variations as speculated by early studies on the ChMs [ 61]?
__label__positive To what extent are star- to-star metallicity variations present among 2P stars?
__label__positive Understanding the physical reasons for this new phenomenon is crucial to constrain the chemical composition of the primordial clouds from which 1P formed and reconstruct the series of events that led to the formation of the 2P .
__label__positive • Work based on N-body simulations of GC stars has shown that the frequency of binaries among multiple populations and their 3D kinematics and spatial dis- tributions would provide information on the initial configuration of 1P and 2P stars [198,205,275,276] .
__label__positive Nevertheless, observational constraints are provided for a handful of GCs only [201,204,209–212,277] .
__label__positive Moreover, these studies are often lim- ited to the central cluster regions, where the initial configuration of 1P and 2P stars have been erased by the GC dynamical evolution.
__label__positive We opine that homogeneous and extensive investigation of internal proper motions, radial velocities, and spatial distri- butions of 1P and 2P stars, together with accurate determinations of the frequency of binaries among multiple populations over the entire cluster, will lead to important information on the origin of multiple populations.
__label__positive • It is now widely accepted that some properties of multiple populations, such as the maximum internal variation of helium and nitrogen, mostly depend on cluster mass.
__label__positive Universe 2022 ,8, 359 29 of 41 To understand the formation process, it would be important to understand whether or not other parameters (e.g., age) govern the multiple population phenomenon.
__label__positive Con- clusions on mass are mainly based on the investigation of homogeneous photometry of60 GCs that represent only about one fourth of the Milky-Way GCs.
__label__positive Elemental abundances from spectroscopy are available for an even smaller sample of clusters.
__label__positive To fully understand the dependence of multiple populations, it is mandatory to increase the number of clusters with homogeneous chemical-abundance determination.
__label__positive • Most of the studies on multiple populations are based on stars more massive than 0.6M, which is a small fraction of GC stars.
__label__positive Indeed, it is challenging to derive precise spectroscopy or UV photometry of faint low-mass stars.
__label__positive The JWST will cer- tainly provide detailed information of multiple populations among very low-mass stars by means of IR photometry and low-resolution spectra.
__label__positive The exploration of the M dwarf realm and the comparison of some multiple population properties, such as mass functions and chemical compositions, in this very low-mass regime with those of more massive GC stars have the potential of disentangling among the formation scenarios.
__label__positive • It is crucial to understand whether the eMSTO observed in star clusters younger than 2 Gyr are entirely due to stellar rotation, or if at least some clusters host multiple stellar generations.
__label__positive Are the eMSTOs and the multiple populations observed in old GCs two different aspects of the same phenomenon?
__label__positive What are the physical reasons responsible for stellar populations with different rotation rates in young star clusters?
__label__positive The MS turn-on is very sensitive to cluster age while poorly affected by rotation.
__label__positive Pioneering work shows that the turn-on is an exquisite clock that can be used to precisely date the stellar populations in young clusters and disentangle the effect of age and rotation [ 272].
__label__positive Furthermore, the investigation of new features of the CMDs of young clusters such as the recently discovered ‘UV-dim’ stars would provide new insights on the eMSTO phenomenon [259].
__label__positive • Asteroseismology is a novel and powerful tool to estimate stellar masses.
__label__positive Future space missions dedicated to high-precision, high-cadence, long photometric series in dense stellar ﬁelds such as the proposed HAYDN mission [ 278] can provide accurate asteroseismic constraints for GC stars.
__label__positive As an example, it will be possible to infer the amount of RGB mass loss of 1P and 2P stars, thus providing further insights on the impact of mass loss on the HB morphology.
__label__positive Moreover, the asteroseismic masses will allow us to gather new estimates of the helium content of multiple populations that are not based neither on isochrones nor on spectroscopy.
__label__positive Indeed, for a ﬁxed luminosity, age, and metallicity, the mass of MS, SGB, and RGB stars depend on their helium abundances.
__label__positive [280] for pioneering studies on stellar populations in GCs based on asteroseismology.
__label__positive • Direct observations of newly born GCs in the early Universe would allow us to understand whether GC precursors were signiﬁcantly more massive than their present- day counterparts or not.
__label__positive We expect that next-generation telescopes such as JWST and ELT will have the potential to detect forming GCs at high redshift and constrain their masses, thus addressing one of the main questions raised by the multiple population phenomenon [5].

__label__positive Notes 1The most used ChMs are derived for RGB stars from the mF814W vs.mF275W mF814W CMD and the mF814W vs.CF275W,F336W,F438W pseudo-CMD.
__label__positive The ﬁrst step for building the ChM consists in deriving the red and blue boundaries of the RGB in both dia- grams.
__label__positive Each diagram is then verticalized in such a way that the red and blue RGB boundaries translate into vertical segments.
__label__positive Speciﬁcally, for each star we calculate the quantities DF275W,F814W =WF275W,F814WX Xﬁducial R Xﬁducial R Xﬁducial BandDCF275W,F336W,F438W = WCF275W,F336W,F438WY Yﬁducial R Yﬁducial R Yﬁducial B.
__label__positive Here, X=mF275W mF814W ,Y=CF275W,F336W,F438W and ‘ﬁducial R’ and ‘ﬁducial B’ correspond to the red and the blue RGB boundaries.
__label__positive WF275W,F814W and WCF275W,F336W,F438W are the RGB widths in the corre- sponding diagrams and are calculated 2.0 F814W mag above the MS turn off.
__label__positive The traditional ChM is obtained by plotting DCF275W,F336W,F438W as a function of DF275W,F814W for RGB stars.
__label__positive A similar procedure is used to derive the ChM of MS and AGB.
__label__positive 2The MS knee is a typical feature of NIR CMDs of stellar populations.
__label__positive It is the result of two competing phenomena that involve MS stars less massive than 0.4M.
__label__positive On one side, the increase of the collision-induced absorption of H2molecule moves the stellar ﬂux to the blue.
__label__positive On the other side, the decrease in effective temperature, together with the increase of shift the color of stars to the red [62,63].
__label__positive 3A major limitation in investigating the lithium abundance of GC stars is that due to lithium destruction in stellar interiors the [Li/H] value strongly depends on the evolutionary phase.
__label__positive As illustrated in accurate spectroscopic study of the metal-poor GC NGC 6397, we observe nearly constant [Li/H] among MS stars.
__label__positive Such a lithium plateau is followed by ﬁrst a drop in the middle of the SGB, which is associated to the ﬁrst dredge-up, and a second one that corresponds to the RGB bump [ 115].
__label__positive As a consequence, the investigation of relative lithium abundances among multiple populations is limited to stars fainter than the RGB bump in the same evolutionary phase.
__label__positive 4The Cameron–Fowler mechanism can produce lithium in intermediate-mass AGB stars.
__label__positive Convection brings to the outer layers the products of the reaction3He(a,g)7Be, which takes place in the stellar interiors.
__label__positive Lithium is then produced via the reaction 7Be(e ,n).
__label__positive 5Popper [123] discovered that the red giant star L199 in the GC M13 exhibits stronger CN molecular bands when compared to the other studied giants.
__label__positive To our knowledge, his ﬁnding can be considered the ﬁrst evidence of multiple populations in a GC (see also [124–127], and references therein).
__label__positive 6The fact that observational errors depend on radial distance provides a major challenge in properly identifying the distinct populations across the GC ﬁeld of view and in deriving their radial and spatial distributions.
__label__positive For this reason, we only consider those clusters where it is possible to clearly disentangle 1P and 2P stars.
__label__positive 7In this context, it is worth noting that Leaman et al.
__label__positive [225] ﬁrst detect different sequences in the age-metallicity space for GCs with disc and halo kinematics, and they interpreted these differences as signature of in-situ vs.

__label__positive Received 2020 January 8; in original form 2019 October 21 ABSTRACT We perform a detailed numerical and analytical study of the properties of observed light curves from relativistic thin discs, focussing on observational bands most appropriate forcomparison with tidal disruption events (TDEs).
__label__positive We make use of asymptotic expansion techniques applied to the spectral emission integral, using time-dependent disc temperature proﬁles appropriate for solutions of the relativistic thin disc equation.
__label__positive Rather than a powerlaw associated with bolometric disc emission L∼t −n, the observed X-ray ﬂux from disc- dominated TDEs will typically have the form of a power law multiplied by an exponential (see equation 91).
__label__positive While precise details are somewhat dependent on the nature of the ISCOstress and disc-observer orientational angle, the general form of the time-dependent ﬂux isrobust and insensitive to the exact disc temperature proﬁle.
__label__positive We present numerical ﬁts to the UV and X-ray light curves of ASASSN-14li, a particularly well observed TDE.
__label__positive This modelling incorporates strong gravity optics.
__label__positive The full 900 d of ASASSN-14li X-ray observations arevery well ﬁt by a simple relativistic disc model, signiﬁcantly improving upon previous work.
__label__positive The same underlying model also ﬁts the ﬁnal 1000 d of ASASSN-14li observations in three different UV bandpasses.
__label__positive Finally, we demonstrate that the analytic formulae reproducethe properties of full numerical modelling at both UV and X-ray wavelengths with great ﬁdelity.
__label__positive Key words: accretion, accretion discs – black hole physics – turbulence.
__label__positive 1 INTRODUCTION The evolution of bright ﬂares following the tidal destruction of a star passing near the horizon of a supermassive black hole, a so-called tidal disruption event (TDE), comprise a particularlyinteresting application of relativistic disc theory.
__label__positive In a recent series of papers (Mummery & Balbus 2019a, b ; hereafter MB1 ,MB2 ), the authors have studied the solutions of the thin disc equationvalid in Kerr space–time geometries.
__label__positive The models studied were necessarily idealized in many ways: in addition to the standard thin disc assumptions, the models did not include fallback on to thedisc or outﬂows in the form of a jet or wind, the disc was assumed to be conﬁned to the Kerr geometry symmetry plane, and the stress tensor was parametrized as the product of power laws in surfacedensity and radius, in accord with standard α-disc modelling.
__label__positive By stipulating a mathematically stable regime for the stress, these studies did not address the possible presence of Lightman–Eardleyviscous instabilities.
__label__positive Nevertheless, by stripping the problem down to its simplest form an important result emerged: the choice of disc ⋆E-mail: andrew.mummery@physics.ox.ac.uk (AM); steven.balbus@physics.ox.ac.uk (SAB)inner boundary conditions leads to very distinct predictions for the behaviour of the late time ( t) bolometric luminosity.
__label__positive The presence of an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) within a relativistic disc implies that the disc must be in effect cut-off, since gas interior to this radius, facing no angular momentum barrier, isable to plunge towards the centre.
__label__positive A purely viscous stress would arguably vanish at this location (e.g.
__label__positive Page & Thorne 1974 ), as it does at a free ﬂuid boundary.
__label__positive Astrophysical discs are much morelikely to be dominated by a magnetic stress.
__label__positive As this requires only correlated (radial and azimuthal) magnetic ﬁelds to be present, there is no reason for this quantity to vanish at the ISCO.
__label__positive This is ofastrophysical importance, since the presence or absence of an ISCO stress changes the late-time behaviour of the emergent bolometric luminosity, L(t).
__label__positive Generally, L(t) behaves as a power law ∼t −nat late times.
__label__positive For a vanishing ISCO stress, Lfalls off more steeply than t−1(Cannizzo, Lee & Goodman 1990 ), whereas for a ﬁnite ISCO stress, the fall off is less steep than t−1(Balbus & Mummery 2018 ,BM18 ).
__label__positive Recent high-quality data for four ‘conﬁrmed’ late- time X-ray TDEs (Auchettl, Guillochon & Ramirez-Ruiz 2017 ) all show the latter, more shallow, decline for their light curves.This is very suggestive, if indirect, evidence for the presence of a ﬁnite ISCO stress, which has historically been a somewhat contentious theoretical issue (Gammie 1999 ; Krolik 1999 ; Agol & Krolik 2000 ).

__label__positive Balbus The theoretical luminosity calculations described above are bolo- metric, whereas observations are always taken over a well-deﬁnedinstrumental bandpass.
__label__positive It is of interest therefore to investigate the time-dependent emission from the simple 1D relativistic disc models of MB1 andMB2 over prescribed wavelength intervals.
__label__positive In this work, we both use and generalize asymptotic expansion techniques applied to the disc spectral integral (Balbus 2014 )t o derive rather simple, but fully time-dependent, analytic expressionsappropriate to UV and X-ray bandpasses.
__label__positive These are very general results with wide applicability.
__label__positive In principle, such calculations, when ﬁtted to observations, can reveal important properties of both thedisc and the host black hole.
__label__positive As an application of this asymptotic analysis, we present direct data ﬁts to the conﬁrmed TDE ASASSN-14li, a particularly well-observed TDE ﬁrst discovered on 2014 November 22 (Holoien et al.

__label__positive Spectrally ASASSN-14li belongs to a so-called ‘supersoft’ class of TDEs, which are characterized by X-ray spectra that have been modelledby a blackbody proﬁle (Miller et al.
__label__positive The well-sampled light curves and likely thermal origin of the emitted ﬂux makes ASASSN-14li an ideal candidate for our analysis.
__label__positive Inthis paper, we apply a simple relativistic disc model to this system, ﬁtted to the evolving UV and X-ray light curves.
__label__positive We ﬁnd that this model not only provides a signiﬁcantly improved ﬁt to the observedX-ray light curve of ASASSN-14li when compared to other models in the literature, but also it simultaneously ﬁts the late-time ( t> 200 d) UV emission.
__label__positive Both the thin disc dynamics and the ray-tracing calculations are fully relativistic.

__label__positive 2 RELATIVISTIC DISC SPECTRUM 2.1 Dynamical equation The underlying disc model describes the evolution of the az- imuthally averaged, height-integrated disc surface density /Sigma1(r,t).
__label__positive Standard cylindrical Kerr geometry Boyer–Lindquist coordinates are used: r(radius), φ(azimuth), z(height), t(time), and d τ (invariant line element).
__label__positive The contravariant four velocity of the discﬂuid is denoted U μ(related to coordinate xμbyUμ=dxμ/dτ); its covariant counterpart is Uμ.
__label__positive The speciﬁc angular momentum corresponds to Uφ, a covariant quantity.
__label__positive We assume that there is an anomalous stress tensor present, Wr φ, due to low-level disc turbulence.
__label__positive The stress is a measure of the correlation between the ﬂuctuations in Urand Uφ(Balbus 2017 ), and could also includecorrelated magnetic ﬁelds.
__label__positive As its notation suggests, Wr φis a mixed tensor of rank two.
__label__positive It is convenient to introduce the quantity ζ, ζ≡√g/Sigma1Wr φ/U0=r/Sigma1Wr φ/U0, (1) where g>0 is the absolute value of the determinant of the (mid- plane) Kerr metric tensor gμν.
__label__positive The Kerr metric describes the space– time external to a black hole of mass Mand angular momentum J.
__label__positive For our choice of (mid-plane) coordinates,√g=r.T h eI S C O radius, inside of which the disc is rotationally unstable, is denoted as rI.
__label__positive Other notation is standard: the gravitation radius is rg=GM/c2, and the black hole spin parameter is a=J/Mc.
__label__positive Under these assumptions, the governing equation for the evo- lution of the disc may generally be written (Eardley & Lightman1975 ;B a l b u s 2017 ): ∂ζ ∂t=W∂ ∂r/parenleftBigg U0 U/prime φ∂ζ ∂r/parenrightBigg , (2) where the primed notation denotes a radial gradient, and we have deﬁned the stress-like quantity W≡1 (U0)2/parenleftbigg Wr φ+/Sigma1∂Wr φ ∂/Sigma1/parenrightbigg .
__label__positive (3) The properties of this equation and its time-dependent solutions have been discussed in some detail in BM18 ,MB1 ,a n d MB2 .
__label__positive 2.2 Spectral integral The dominant rφcomponent of the turbulent stress tensor Wr φ serves to transport angular momentum outward as well as to extract the free energy of the disc shear, which is then thermalized and radiated from the disc surface.
__label__positive In standard α-disc modelling, which we follow here, both the extraction and the dissipation are assumed to be local processes.
__label__positive With these assumptions, the proﬁle of the disc surface temperature Tis given by (Balbus 2017 ) σT4=−U0Uφ 2r(ln/Omega1)/primeζ(r,t), (4) where σis the Stefan–Boltzmann constant and /Omega1≡dφ dt=Uφ U0.
__label__positive (5) The speciﬁc ﬂux density Fνof the disc radiation, as observed by a distant observer at rest (subscript o), is given by Fν(νo)=/integraldisplay Iν(νo)d/Theta1o.

__label__positive The disc is assumed to be a multitemperature blackbody, with surface temperature T=T(r,t) given by equation (4).
__label__positive The speciﬁc intensity of the locally emitted radiation is then given by the Planckfunction B ν Iν(νe)=Bν(νe,T)=2hν3 e c2/bracketleftbigg exp/parenleftbigghνe kBT/parenrightbigg −1/bracketrightbigg−1 .

__label__positive (11) To compare our results with Swift X-ray observations, we require FX, the total ﬂux observed between the telescope’s bandpass at 0.3 and 10 keV .
__label__positive This is easily calculated by integrating (11) over thecorresponding (observer) frequency range: F X(t)=/integraldisplayνu νl/integraldisplay Sf3Bν(νo/f , T )d/Theta1odνo.

__label__positive With Tgiven by equations (2) and (4), and ray-tracing calculations determining f(α,β), the observed spectrum may be obtained with relativistic effects (kinematic and gravitational Doppler shifts, and gravitationallensing) included.
__label__positive These are needed for detailed comparison with observations at X-ray wavelengths.
__label__positive Finally, we note that radiative transfer physics such as absorption and Compton scattering ofphotons as they pass through the disc atmosphere has been ignored, a simpliﬁcation that is often made.
__label__positive For spectrally ‘supersoft’ TDEs like ASASSN-14li these corrections are likely to be modest, asany large effects would result in noticeable deviations from simple integrated blackbody spectra.
__label__positive A more detailed radiative treatmentis of interest, but will be left for a later investigation.
__label__positive 3 ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS 3.1 Effective temperature The canonical thermal accretion disc spectrum is by now well known: a low frequency Rayleigh–Jeans tail, an intermediate frequency power-law section (arising from a superposition ofblackbody emission peaks), and a high frequency, quasi-Wien tail.
__label__positive The relativistic case considered here is broadly similar, but with important distinctions in detail.
__label__positive Begin by recasting the equations (11) and (12) into a somewhat more classical form by deﬁning an ‘effective temperature’ /tildewideTby /tildewideT(α,β, t )=f(α,β)T(r(α,β),t).
__label__positive (13) This leads to F ν(νo,t)=2hν3 o c2/integraldisplay S[exp(hνo/kB/tildewideT)−1]−1d/Theta1o, (14) and FX(t)=/integraldisplayνu νl/integraldisplay S2hν3 o c2d/Theta1odνo exp(hνo/kB/tildewideT)−1.
__label__positive (15) The high photon energy behaviour ( hνo/greatermuchkB/tildewideT) of equation (14) may be found analytically by an asymptotic expansion of these integrals, without any detailed knowledge of the underlying discmodel (Balbus 2014 ).
__label__positive By contrast, at intermediate photon energies, knowledge of the spatial and temporal behaviour of Tis required, as are solutions of the relativistic evolution equation (2).
__label__positive Approximateanalytic solutions of the latter are discussed below.
__label__positive 3.2 Self-similar disc solutions As a second-order differential equation, equation (2) has two independent solutions.
__label__positive MB1 showed that the gross properties of relativistic discs can be understood by self-similar solutions of the simpler, large r, Newtonian evolution equation.
__label__positive The key point is that the inner boundary condition that is determined by the ISCO stress,directly affects the behaviour of the disc in the outer zone ( MB2 ).
__label__positive Self-similar solutions exist when the turbulent stress is of the form W r φ=ω/parenleftbigg/Sigma1 /Sigma10/parenrightbiggη/parenleftbiggr r0/parenrightbiggμ , (16) which is applicable to a rather wide range of turbulent disc models, including classical α-discs (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973 ).

__label__positive Balbus For a given ηandμ, the two independent solutions have this same general form, differing only in their constant parameters.
__label__positive We haveveriﬁed by direct numerical integration of equation (2) that over the extended time-scales of interest, the exact solution is generally dominated by one or the other of the self-similar proﬁles ( MB1 ), the choice being dictated by the nature of the ISCO stress.
__label__positive The coefﬁcients may be expressed in terms of ηandμ(Pringle 1991 ).
__label__positive For a ﬁnite ISCO stress the coefﬁcients are B=(5η+3−2μ)/(η+1), (21) C=(3η+1−2μ)/(η+1), (22) k=η/[(4η+3−2μ)(5η+3−2μ)], (23) λ=1/(4η+3−2μ), (24) χ=1/(4η+3−2μ), (25) whereas for a vanishing ISCO stress they are given by B=(4η+3−2μ)/(η+1), (26) C=(3η+2−2μ)/(η+1), (27) k=η/[(4η+3−2μ)(5η+3−2μ)], (28) λ=1/(5η+3−2μ), (29) χ=2/(5η+3−2μ).
__label__positive (30) Substituting the Newtonian self-similar solutions (18)–(20) into the temperature equation (4) leads, after algebraic simpliﬁcation, to a disc temperature proﬁle of the form T(x,τ)=T0x−mτ−n/4ψ(x,τ), (31) where T0=/parenleftBigg 3ω/Sigma1 0 4σ/radicalBigg GM r5 0/parenrightBigg1/4 , (32) and ψ(x,τ)=(1−kxB/2τ−λB)(1+η)/4η.
__label__positive (33) The power-law indices mandnare given by, for a ﬁnite ISCO stress m=7/8, (34) n=4η+2−2μ 4η+3−2μ, (35) and for a vanishing stress m=3/4, (36) n=5η+4−2μ 5η+3−2μ.
__label__positive (37) The index nis the same index that appears in the bolometric luminosity L∼t−n.
__label__positive While ndepends only rather weakly on η andμ, it depends more sensitively upon the ISCO stress: n≈0.8 for ﬁnite ISCO stress modes versus n≈1.2 for vanishing ISCO stress modes ( MB1 ).
__label__positive When confusion may arise from the different values of ‘ n’, we shall denote the ﬁnite ISCO stress decay index (equation 35) by nf, and the vanishing ISCO stress decay index by nv(equation 37).3.3 Rayleigh–Jeans limit The Rayleigh–Jeans limit describes the lowest frequency part of the spectrum, where hνo/lessmuchkB/tildewideTfor all effective temperatures within the disc.
__label__positive At these frequencies we may expand the exponential: exp(hνo/kB/tildewideT)−1=hνo/kB/tildewideT+...
__label__positive , (38) and thus the time dependence of the Rayleigh–Jeans ﬂux follows that of the disc temperature.
__label__positive At late times, we obtain from equa- tions (14) and (31) Fν(νo,t)∼ν2 ot−n/4.
__label__positive (39) 3.4 Mid-range frequencies Each disc radius has both a characteristic temperature (31) and characteristic frequency ν∼kBT/h.
__label__positive At intermediate frequencies where Tout/lessmuchhν/kB/lessmuchT0,w h e r e Toutis a typical temperature of the outer disc, the ﬂux originates primarily from (Newtonian) regionswhere the self-similar solutions (18) are a good approximation.
__label__positive In this regime, relativistic Doppler shifts are negligible ( f/similarequal1) and gravitational optics unimportant: photons travel in nearly straightlines.
__label__positive This allows a further simpliﬁcation of the integrals by using the standard Newtonian form for the solid angle element of emission, d/Theta1 o=dαdβ D2=2πr D2cosθobsdr.
__label__positive (40) In this limit, the ﬂux can be written as an integral over the dimensionless disc radius x=r/r0from a suitable inner radius xinto the outer radius xout: Fν(νo,t)=A/integraldisplayxout xinx/bracketleftbigg exp/parenleftbigg/epsilon1xmτn/4 ψ(x,τ)/parenrightbigg −1/bracketrightbigg−1 dx, (41) where the constants Aand/epsilon1are given by A=4πhr2 0ν3 ocosθobs/(c2D2),/epsilon1=hνo/kBT0.
__label__positive (42) At late times, the dominant contribution of the mid-frequency ﬂux comes from radii where x1/2τ−λis small and ψ/similarequal1.
__label__positive With little contribution coming from either large or small radii, to leading order the limits of integration can be extended from 0 to ∞, and the integral becomes Fν=A/integraldisplay∞ 0x[e/epsilon1xmτn/4−1]−1dx.

__label__positive Spectral evolution of disc dominated TDEs 5659 3.5 Evolution of the mid-frequency spectral shape Our results suggest that when observed at frequencies below the thermal spectrum peak, some care is required when extracting the exact time dependence of the observed ﬂux in a narrow observational band.
__label__positive As the disc cools and expands, the spectrum peaks at lower frequencies and decreases in overall magnitude.
__label__positive The peak frequency νpis related to the peak effective temperature by νp∼kB/tildewideTp h∼t−n/4.
__label__positive (47) (We have used equation 31 for the time dependence of /tildewideTp;s e e Section 3.6 below for further discussion.
__label__positive ) Below the peak of the spectrum, the ﬂux increases as a power law with ν(equations 45 and 46).
__label__positive The shifting of the peak of the spectrum to lower frequenciescombined with a decreasing overall magnitude of the spectrum means that the observed ﬂux at a particular frequency (or in a surrounding narrow band) will tend to remain nearly constant – oreven increase – with time.
__label__positive Only at much later times will the observed ﬂux follow the power-law declines derived earlier (equations 45 and 46).
__label__positive As we shall see, this subtle behaviour appears to present in theobserved narrow band light curves of ASASSN-14li.
__label__positive 3.6 Quasi-Wien limit The quasi-Wien limit of the disc spectrum is characterized by the largest photon energies, hν o/greatermuchkB/tildewideTp.
__label__positive (48) In this limit, all of the emission is strongly concentrated near the temperature maximum, and we may simplify the denominator of (14) by neglecting the −1, since this introduces only exponentially small corrections.
__label__positive The ﬂux is then formally given by Fν(νo,t)=2hν3 o D2c2/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Sexp(−hνo/kB/tildewideT)dαdβ.
__label__positive (49) Since only the hottest parts of the disc very near the tempera- ture maximum contribute to the observed ﬂux, the integral may be evaluated using Laplace’s method (e.g.
__label__positive We follow Balbus ( 2014 ) by Taylor expanding in the inverse of the effective temperature about the effective temperature maximum.
__label__positive The details will depend both on the properties of the ISCO stress (which affect the location of the disc temperature maximum), and the disc viewing angle (which affects the projected geometry of the hot inner disc).
__label__positive Current models of TDE evolution suggest thatthere should be a rather strong viewing angle dependence of the observed ﬂux, with observable X-ray emission only when the disc is orientated near face-on (Dai et al.
__label__positive We shall therefore assume here that the disc is oriented nearly face-on.
__label__positive Asymptotic solutions of equation (49) may be straightforwardly obtained for different disc orientations and ISCO stress assumptions; these arepresented in Section 6 (vanishing ISCO stress), and Appendix B (different orientation angles).
__label__positive For a face-on disc, there is little kinematic Doppler shifting of the observed radiation, and the effective temperature proﬁle is therefore azimuthally symmetric in the image plane.
__label__positive We may therefore expand in the radial image plane coordinate R: R≡/radicalbig α2+β2.
__label__positive (50)The expansion of the effective temperature is then 1 kB/tildewideT=1 kB/tildewideTp+1 kB/tildewideT2 p/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle∂/tildewideT ∂R/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle Rp/parenleftbig R−Rp/parenrightbig +..., (51) where we have used the fact that for a disc with a ﬁnite ISCO stress the peak temperature /tildewideTplies on the inner disc boundary at radial coordinate Rpin the image plane.
__label__positive For clarity, the (negative) temperature gradient appears here as an absolute value.
__label__positive It is possible to expand the observed ﬂux to arbitrarily high powers of the smallparameter δ≡k B/tildewideTp hνo/lessmuch1, (52) by keeping higher order terms in the Taylor expansion (51).
__label__positive We will see, however, that for our purposes the leading order behaviour is sufﬁcient.
__label__positive While all of the spatial dependence of the effective tem- perature is explicit in equation (51), it is important to remember thatthe peak effective temperature and effective temperature gradient are time-dependent quantities.

__label__positive (55) We recover the modiﬁed-Wien ν2frequency dependence ﬁrst noted by Balbus ( 2014 ).
__label__positive The implicit time dependence of the ﬂux enters via the disc temperature.
__label__positive The integral over the X-ray frequency band then follows straightforwardly: FX(t)=/integraldisplay∞ νlFν(νo,t)dνo, (56) where the lower limit νlcorresponds to 0.3 keV for the Swift ASASSN-14li observations, and the upper integration limit is setto inﬁnity (introducing only exponentially small corrections).

__label__positive We next revisit the question raised in Section 3.5, namely what form does the time dependence of the peak disc temperature take?
__label__positive With xpﬁxed, in a Newtonian disc the peak temperature follows a simple power law in time Tp∼t−n/4(equation 31).
__label__positive In a relativistic disc, the temperature in the innermost regions is not in general given by equation (31).
__label__positive However, the temporal behaviour of the disc MNRAS 492, 5655–5674 (2020)Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/492/4/5655/5714123 by guest on 22 March 2023
__label__positive The approximation of equa- tion (58) is valid to within a few per cent after 200 d.
__label__positive The y-axis is normalized so as to equal 1 at a time corresponding to the end of theavailable observations of ASASSN-14li.
__label__positive temperature in the innermost regions is unlikely to be systematically different from that of the outer disc, since the Newtonian andrelativistic regimes of the disc must join smoothly at all times.
__label__positive We therefore assume a peak temperature functional form of /tildewideT p(t)≡Tpτ−n/4, (58) where Tpis a constant with dimensions of temperature and τis the time in units of the viscous time-scale.
__label__positive The viscous time-scale τfor a Green’s function solution is deﬁned in terms of the initial radius r0(equation 17), and could in principal include a time offset t0to provide a ﬁnite X-ray luminosity as t→0.
__label__positive This assumption has been checked and explicitly veriﬁed by exact numerical calculation (Fig.
__label__positive This result now allows us to calculate the explicit time dependence of FνandFX: Fν(νo,t)=4π ξc2/parenleftbiggRp D/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbiggkBTp hνo/parenrightbigg hν3 o ×τ−n/4exp/parenleftbigg −hνo kBTpτn/4/parenrightbigg , (59) and FX(t)=4π ξc2/parenleftbiggRp D/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbiggkBTp hνl/parenrightbigg2 hνl4 ×τ−n/2exp/parenleftbigg −hνl kBTpτn/4/parenrightbigg , (60) with n≈0.8.
__label__positive The underlying assumptions and approximations that have gone into equation (60) are: (i) The emission is well approximated as thermal (equation 11).
__label__positive (ii) The emission is in the quasi-Wien limit, hνl/greatermuchkBTp.
__label__positive (iv) The peak temperature occurs at the innermost disc edge.
__label__positive Note that, for the solutions under consideration, the assumption that the peak temperature lies at the inner disc edge is, in effect,equivalent to assuming a ﬁnite ISCO stress.
__label__positive These results are likely to be valid under conditions rather more general than the thin disc model per se .
__label__positive In Appendix C, we present analytic expressions for theFigure 3.
__label__positive The low, mid, and high frequency asymptotic regimes are delineated.

__label__positive The functional form of (60) turns out to be rather insensitive to the precise viewing angle.
__label__positive 3.7 Summary The observed ﬂux in several different limits of physical interest may be obtained by taking appropriate expansions of the integral (11)(Fig.
__label__positive We ﬁnd that that even if the bolometric luminosity follows a simple power-law decline L∼t −n, the observed ﬁnite bandpass ﬂux will often have a different temporal behaviour.
__label__positive For example, ifX-ray observations probe the quasi-Wien tail of the evolving disc spectrum, then rather than a power-law decay, the X-ray light curves of transient disc sources is described by a function of the form F X(t)=F0/parenleftbiggt+t0 tX/parenrightbigg−n/2 exp/bracketleftBigg −/parenleftbiggt+t0 tX/parenrightbiggn/4/bracketrightBigg , (61) with n≈0.8, and F0,t0,a n d tXtime-independent constants.
__label__positive At the very largest times the X-ray light curve becomes dominated by an exponential of a power law in time, with power-law index less than 1 in magnitude.
__label__positive We therefore expect the true X-ray luminosityof a TDE source to follow a decline that is steeper than a power law but more shallow than a pure exponential.
__label__positive Furthermore, if the UV luminosity is dominated by disc emission, this bandpass shouldbe characterized by a nearly constant luminosity.
__label__positive This (perhaps) counterintuitive results stems from the combination of a decreasing temperature coupled with an increasing radial extent that places thepeak of emission at smaller frequencies.
__label__positive At frequencies below but near the peak frequency of the disc spectrum, the observed ﬂux remains near constant.
__label__positive These results will be discussed in detail inSection 4.

__label__positive For a given disc inclination angle μ=cos (θ obs), ray-tracing calculations allow the observed redshift (8) to be calculated.
__label__positive We calculate spectra at (narrow band) UV and (broad-band) X-raywavelengths.
__label__positive Such simultaneous ﬁts at frequencies which differ by two orders of magnitude tightly constrain the model parameters.
__label__positive For the narrower UV bands, we simply compute the evolving ﬂux at the central wavelength of each UV band.
__label__positive For the three Swift bands of interest (UVW1, UVW2, and UVM2) these are: 1 ¯λW1=260.0n m, (62) ¯λM2=224.6n m, (63) ¯λW2=192.8n m.

__label__positive (65) Here, Fνis calculated from equation (11), and has units of erg s−1cm−2Hz−1.

__label__positive 4.2 Model parameters In general, there are nine parameters which completely specify an evolving disc model.
__label__positive These parameters, which are described below, involve the observer orientation, the initial disc conditions, the turbulent stress, and the mass and angular momentum of thecentral black hole.
__label__positive 4.2.1 Observer parameters This distance to the source serves as an overall normalization of the observed ﬂux, one that often is not accurately known.
__label__positive The distance to ASASSN-14li is the exception however: it is tightly constrained by its well-identiﬁed host galaxy: PGC 043234 (Holoien et al.
__label__positive The disc-observer inclination angle is unknown for ASASSN-14li.
__label__positive As earlier noted, current TDE models suggest that sources observed at X-ray wavelengths are expected to be orientated near face-on, θ obs/lessorsimilar20◦(Dai et al.
__label__positive Given the lack of observational constraints and the expectation of a nearface-on orientation, we shall assume for simplicity that cos ( θ obs)= 1.
__label__positive In principle, our approach could be readily extended to model the observed X-ray and UV ﬂuxes for a variety of different viewingangles.
__label__positive 4.2.2 Central black hole parameters A stationary black hole is completely described by exactly two parameters: its mass and spin.
__label__positive The mass of the central black hole 1http://www.swift.ac.uk/analysis/uvot/ﬁlters.phpis somewhat constrained by previous observations.
__label__positive Using measure-ments of the host galaxy’s bulge mass and standard SMBH–hostgalaxy scaling relationships, Mendel et al.
__label__positive ( 2014 ) derived a black hole mass of M∼10 6.7±0.6M⊙.
__label__positive Somewhat tighter constraints were found by Wevers et al.
__label__positive ( 2017 ), who performed velocity dispersion measurements and found a black hole mass of M=106.23±0.4M⊙.
__label__positive On the other hand, using Eddington-limit arguments Miller et al.
__label__positive As these relationships are broadly uncertain, in our model ﬁtting we have allowed the black hole mass to vary within the range 106<M/M⊙<107.
__label__positive (66) The angular momentum of the central black hole is even less tightly constrained by observations.
__label__positive ( 2019 ) reported a recent measurement of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the observedASASSN-14li X-ray spectrum.
__label__positive This was used to set upper and lower bounds on the black hole parameters: a high prograde spin (a/r g>0.7), and a mass less than M=2×106M⊙.H o w e v e r , the exact black hole mass and spin parameters inferred from QPO measurements are heavily dependent upon the underlying model for the origin of the QPO, something that is at present uncertain(Pasham et al.
__label__positive Here, we shall present our own analysis of the angular momentum of the ASASSN-14li black hole.
__label__positive In the following section, we model thespectral ﬁts for a somewhat more slowly rotating Kerr black hole, a/r g=0.5.
__label__positive In Section 5, we study the effect of varying the black holes spin on the evolving disc light curves.
__label__positive 4.2.3 Turbulent stress modelling As in our previous studies, we consider a turbulent stress of the general form Wr φ=ω/parenleftbigg/Sigma1 /Sigma10/parenrightbiggη/parenleftbiggr r0/parenrightbiggμ .
__label__positive (67) The precise parametrization of Wr φaffects the time-dependent properties of the disc in two ways.
__label__positive The ﬁrst is through its effects on the bolometric decay index n.
__label__positive This enters several expressions for the time-dependent ﬂux at a number of different wavelengths(e.g.
__label__positive The value of ndepends only weakly on the exact parametrization of the stress (the indices ηandμ).
__label__positive By contrast, it is strongly dependent on the nature of the stress at theISCO.
__label__positive The bolometric decay index nis given by n=4η+2−2μ 4η+3−2μ, (68) for a ﬁnite ISCO stress ( MB1 ), whereas for a vanishing ISCO stress n=5η+4−2μ 5η+3−2μ.
__label__positive (69) Because of the limited effect of the exact turbulent stress parametrization on the decay index n, we employ a simple self- similar turbulent stress model Wr φ=w=constant (i.e.
__label__positive This model is also physically rather natural: it would emerge, for example, if the turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations follow a Keplerian scaling of the form δvr∼δvφ∼r−1/2.
__label__positive To avoid unsus- tainable behaviour at latest times, we follow the ‘quasi-circular’ orbit approach developed in MB2 .
__label__positive This allows for deviations in the mean ﬂuid motion of the disc from that of exact Kerr-circular orbits.
__label__positive These deviations must of course be present at some level, as a consequence of non-zero radial velocities in the innermost MNRAS 492, 5655–5674 (2020)Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/492/4/5655/5714123 by guest on 22 March 2023
__label__positive The degree to which the mean ﬂuid motion deviates from perfect circular orbits may be parametrized by a dimensionlessnumber, denoted as γ(MB2 ).
__label__positive The γparameter is deﬁned by γ≡/Delta1j u r Wr φ, (70) where urandWr φare the radial velocity and turbulent stress measured at the ISCO, and /Delta1jis the difference in the disc ﬂuids ISCO angular momentum from that of a circular orbit.
__label__positive A ﬁnite ISCO stress disc model with precisely circular orbits would therefore haveγ=0, whereas a vanishing ISCO stress disc must have γ→∞ .
__label__positive The properties of γcannot as yet be calculated from ﬁrst principles.
__label__positive We therefore must rely on simulations to determine its value andvariability.
__label__positive Current estimates based upon GRMHD simulations placeγwithin the range 0.01 <γ< 0.1.
__label__positive The dimensionless parameter γsets the time-scale over which the ﬁnite ISCO stress modes (equation 18) dominate the behaviour of the disc ( MB2 ).
__label__positive For small γ, the disc evolution is dominated by these modes for the entire observationalperiod.
__label__positive The next important parameter is the magnitude of the turbulent stress, w.
__label__positive For an evolving disc, wsets the duration of the ‘viscous’ time-scale t v.
__label__positive For our choice of ηandμthis is given by tv=2/radicalBig GMr3 0/slashbig 9w, (71) where r0is a radius of the initial disc ring (Appendix A,BM18 ).
__label__positive The stress amplitude wis determined from a best ﬁt to the viscous evolution time-scale, calculated using the above.
__label__positive 4.2.4 Disc initial condition The initial event which produced ASASSN-14li was not observed.
__label__positive Prior to this date, its host galaxy PGC 043234 had not been observedsince the 13th of July 2014, when no TDE was present, as the sun was obscuring this galaxy.
__label__positive This leaves a 132 d window between observations within which the initial disruption could have occurred.
__label__positive We therefore leave the ‘disc formation time’ t D(the time at which we begin the disc evolution), as an additional freeparameter: −132<t D−56983 .6( M J D ) <0, (72) where 56983.6 MJD corresponds to the Julian Date of the ﬁrst recorded observation.
__label__positive We take the initial density distribution of our disc to be a numerical delta function at a ﬁxed radius of r0=15rg.
__label__positive This radius is equal to the tidal radius of a main-sequence star with the mean stellar mass M⋆=0.36 M ⊙(Kroupa 2001 ) around a 2 ×106M⊙ black hole, the best estimate of the black hole mass prior to ﬁtting.
__label__positive The process of disc formation post-TDE is dynamically complex.
__label__positive In reality, the initial matter distribution will depend upon the structure and orbit of the pre-disruption star and the mass and spin of the central black hole.
__label__positive This initial condition is thus an idealization.However, the behaviour of disc light curves post-peak is in fact well- described by sets of self-similar solutions (equation 18), and these have lost memory of the initial conditions ( MB1 ).
__label__positive Comparisons to the post-peak observations of ASASSN-14li are thus likely to be insensitive to the precise spatial form of the initial density distribution.Table 1.

__label__positive 4.3 Best-ﬁtting parameters Table 1summarizes the best-ﬁtting disc parameters for the recorded observations of ASASSN-14li.
__label__positive Table 2summarizes the parameters that remained ﬁxed for the ﬁtting procedure.
__label__positive The four ﬁtted param- eters may be divided into two categories: those that predominantlyaffect the evolutionary time-scale of the system, and those that set the overarching scale of the emission.
__label__positive The viscous time-scale of the evolving disc t vand the disc formation time tDare well constrained by the X-ray observations, which are strongly time varying.
__label__positive Our best-ﬁtting time offset tDis also consistent with an independent estimate of the TDE start timefrom radio observations (Alexander et al.
__label__positive 2016 ), which must pre- date the disc formation time.
__label__positive The remaining two parameters, the disc mass M dand the black hole mass M, are then constrained by the simultaneous ﬁtting of the observed magnitudes of the UV ﬂux and X-ray luminosity.
__label__positive Fitting either band independently is relatively easy, but this leaves large degeneracies in the ﬁtted parameters.This degeneracy is broken only when the light curves are ﬁtted simultaneously.
__label__positive It is extremely encouraging that our best-ﬁtting black hole massM=1.85×10 6M⊙is consistent with a number of existing estimates ( M∼2×106M⊙Miller et al.
__label__positive These estimates comprise a wide range of very distinct methods of evaluating the black hole mass.

__label__positive Spectral evolution of disc dominated TDEs 5663 The best-ﬁtting disc mass, at Md=1.63×10−2M⊙, appears at ﬁrst to be rather small.
__label__positive Rees ( 1988 ) suggests Md∼M⋆/2, where M⋆is the mass of the star prior to disruption.
__label__positive However, our best- ﬁtting disc mass is in fact consistent with existing estimates of the total accreted mass of a number of TDE candidates.
__label__positive ( 2016b ) estimated the total accreted mass of three TDEs, using the observed luminosity and simple energetic arguments.
__label__positive They found accreted masses in the range Macc∼10−3–10−2M⊙.G i v e n the uncertainties involved in estimating accreted masses, this is a broadly supportive ﬁnding.
__label__positive Furthermore, it is important to distinguish the inferred disc mass of our model with the total mass fraction of the debris which remains gravitationally bound in the aftermath of the TDE.
__label__positive Our inferred disc mass is a lower bound of the total debris mass, as it representsonly the total evolving mass required to reproduce both the 900 d of observed X-ray emission and the late-time UV emission.
__label__positive The observed UV and X-ray light curves are by no means the only emission stemming from ASASSN-14li.
__label__positive For example, ASASSN- 14li is also a source of signiﬁcant radio emission (van Velzenet al.
__label__positive 2018 ), which presumably stems from the presence of a jet.
__label__positive An additional, rapidly decaying, light-curve component is also required at early times to match the observationsof ASASSN-14li at UV wavelengths (this will be discussed further in Section 4.7).
__label__positive Neither the mass content of the jet or this additional UV component contribute to our best-ﬁtting disc mass.
__label__positive Hence,the actual debris mass is likely to be signiﬁcantly larger than our deduced disc mass.
__label__positive The small disc-to-debris mass ratio can be naturally explained if, preceding its ﬁrst observation, ASASSN-14li was accreting at super-Eddington rates.
__label__positive The likely outﬂow could then produce a large and transient early-time UV ﬂux, whilst removing much ofthe debris mass, leaving a more tightly bound, low-mass disc behind.
__label__positive In this case, we would expect the bolometric luminosity of our disc to be near the Eddington limit at times close to the ﬁrst observation.This prediction will be examined further in Section 4.9.
__label__positive Finally, it is difﬁcult to determine or constrain properties of the initial disc distribution, absent early-time observations.
__label__positive Forexample, the temporal peak of our best-ﬁtting X-ray light curve is chosen to coincide with the peak of the observed X-ray light curve (Fig.
__label__positive This a choice of convenience, and yields a lower bound to the disc mass.
__label__positive The uncertainty here is that if the X-ray ﬂare were signiﬁcantly more luminous at times preceding the ﬁrst observation, the best-ﬁtting mass could be signiﬁcantly larger (soas to increase the inner disc temperatures and emitted X-ray ﬂux).
__label__positive The dynamical physics of post-TDE disc formation is still poorly understood.
__label__positive Our result suggests that only a small fraction of thestellar material settles into an evolving disc at radii close to the black hole.
__label__positive The fate of the majority of the stellar mass thus remains an interesting and open question.
__label__positive 4.4 Disc evolution The evolution of the disc is qualitatively rather simple, as seen in Fig.
__label__positive The temperature in the innermost regions reaches its evolutionary maximum on a simple viscous time-scale.
__label__positive This is dueto disc material rapidly spreading inwards towards the ISCO.
__label__positive Once the disc density reaches a maxima in the inner regions the disc enters the ‘stalled-phase’ of accretion ( MB2 ).
__label__positive This evolutionary phase is characterized by slow evolution of the inner disc (compare the temperature proﬁle in the inner disc regions at 54 and 151 d), whilst the outer disc expands, taking up the angular momentum ofFigure 4.
__label__positive Snapshots of the disc temperature proﬁle at a number of different times (denoted on plot) for our best-ﬁtting model.
__label__positive Best-ﬁtting disc spectrum 200 d after disc formation, the location of UV and X-ray bands is also shown.
__label__positive At yet later times, the disc begins its approach to the steady state: the disc temperature gradually falls in the innerregions, and the outer region of the disc spreads to ever larger radii.
__label__positive 4.5 Continuum spectrum Fig.5is a ﬁducial continuum spectrum 200 d after disc formation.
__label__positive This was calculated using equation (11) and the best-ﬁtting parame-ters of Tables 1and2.
__label__positive The three central frequencies of the UV bands are shown as coloured lines, and the Swift X-ray telescope band is the dashed area on the right of the ﬁgure.
__label__positive This plot demonstratesthat the observed UV ﬂux is below the peak frequency, where we would expect the evolving ﬂux to be near constant with time.
__label__positive The Swift X-ray bands probe the quasi-Wien tail of the spectrum, and should therefore be described by equation (60).

__label__positive Fiducial disc model ﬁt (solid blue curve) to Swift X-ray observations of ASASSN-14li (Bright et al.
__label__positive Also plotted are the two best-ﬁtting models from the literature, a power-law (grey dashed curve) and exponential ﬁt (green dot–dashed curve; see text).
__label__positive The disc model has the lowest reduc ed chi-squared statistic, providing the best ﬁt to the observed ASASSN-14li light curve.
__label__positive ﬂux from our ﬁducial disc model, and previous functional ﬁts from the literature (Bright et al.
__label__positive These previous ﬁts have the form FX(t)=F0/bracketleftbiggt+t0 tX/bracketrightbigg−5/3 (Power-law ﬁt) (74) and FX(t)=F0exp/bracketleftbigg −/parenleftbiggt+t0 tX/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (Exponential ﬁt) .
__label__positive (75) In these models, the ﬁtting parameters F0,t0,a n d tXare uncon- strained.
__label__positive Following Bright et al .in preparation we use the reduced chi-squared as a measure of goodness of ﬁt: ¯χ2≡1 N−dN/summationdisplay i=1(Oi−Mi)2 δO2 i, (76) where the Nobservational quantities, denoted Oi, have associated errorδOi.
__label__positive A model with dfree parameters produces Ncorresponding model predictions, denoted Mi.
__label__positive The X-ray light curve of ASASSN- 14li has N=95 data points, while d=2 for both the power-law and exponential models, d=4 for our disc model.
__label__positive The reduced chi-squared of the three best-ﬁtting models are ¯χ2 power−law=1301.1/93=13.99, (77) ¯χ2 exponential =794.2/93=8.54, (78) ¯χ2 disc=562.8/91=6.19.
__label__positive (79) Given the wide parameter space available to the two ﬁtted functions, it is noteworthy that our disc model provides a signiﬁcantly betteroverall ﬁt to the observed X-ray data than either of the previous ﬁtting functions (Fig.
__label__positive Furthermore, of the two ﬁtted functions the 5/3 power law is the more physically motivated (a 5/3 power law is a direct prediction of the Rees 1988 model).
__label__positive When compared to this pure power-law ﬁt the current disc model gives a strikingly improved ﬁt.
__label__positive In addition, the disc model provides the best ﬁt at the late times, t>600 d, where the three model predictions begin to strongly diverge.
__label__positive Further late-time X-ray observations of ASASSN- 14li would be of great interest, allowing a yet more precise testing of the three models.
__label__positive The qualitative properties of the evolving disc X-ray ﬂux are nicely predicted by equation (60).
__label__positive After an initial phase of rising X-ray ﬂux (whose properties are set entirely by the choice of initialdisc conditions), there is a pronounced light-curve decay.
__label__positive 6, the rate at which the disc X-ray ﬂux falls off is faster than the 5/3 power law, but slower than the pure exponentialexponential decay.
__label__positive This is in accord with an evolving ﬂux with a time dependence given by equation (60).
__label__positive In Section 7, we give a full quantitative comparison of the observed X-ray light curves with theanalytical results of Section 3.
__label__positive Although the ﬁt is good, the model still produces a relatively large formal reduced chi-squared statistic.
__label__positive This is due to the intrinsicallyshort time-scale variations of the X-ray ﬂux, which cannot be accounted for in a simple decay model.
__label__positive These short time-scale ﬂuctuations may be intrinsic to accretion, produced in a jet, orcaused by matter returning to the disc from large radius orbits after the disruption (fallback).
__label__positive It is these short time-scale ﬂuctuations that are the dominant source of model discrepancy, so it is not possible to signiﬁcantly improve on this reduced chi-squared statistic by further adjustment of other parameters in a smooth disc model.

__label__positive Spectral evolution of disc dominated TDEs 5665 4.7 UV light curve Fig.7is a plot of the evolving ﬂux of ASASSN-14li in the UVW1 band (Brown et al.
__label__positive The UVW1 band has a central wavelength of ¯λ=260 nm.
__label__positive The light curve is expressed as an evolving AB magnitude.
__label__positive The best-ﬁtting UVW1 light curve, calculated with equation (65), is plotted as a red-dashed curve.
__label__positive Unlike the evolving X-ray luminosity, the observed UV emissionof ASASSN-14li cannot be ﬁt by pure disc emission at the earliest observed times.
__label__positive At early times we require a second, ad hoc, rapidly decaying, component.
__label__positive To the ﬁrst 100 d of observations, we ﬁt anexponentially decaying component (blue dot–dashed curve) taken from Holoien et al.
__label__positive Assuming that the ﬂux from these two components sum linearly, the total observed ﬂux of the TDE is given by Ftotal ν=Fdisc ν+Fexp ν.
__label__positive (81) This is plotted as the ‘total light curve’ (black solid curve) in Fig.
__label__positive The dominance of an UV component duringthe early evolutionary stages ( t<200 d post-observation), not associated with thermal disc emission, has been noted previously (Pasham et al.
__label__positive After an initial phase dominated by this non-disc component, the evolving UV ﬂux is strongly disc dominated.
__label__positive The ﬁnal 1000 d of ASASSN-14li UV ﬂux are almost completely unchanging with time.
__label__positive As argued in Section 3.5, this is precisely what would beexpected for bandpasses at frequencies below the thermal spectral peak, a condition satisﬁed here (see Fig.
__label__positive 4.8 Characteristic observed temperatures In ﬁtting observations of TDEs taken in a single band, modellers often use a single characteristic temperature.
__label__positive For example, two distinct characteristic UV and X-ray temperatures of ASSASN- 14li were reported in Brown et al.
__label__positive A single temperature is generally inferred by ﬁtting a pure blackbody function to the observed spectrum i.e.
__label__positive a Planck function (9), neglecting photonredshifting ( f/similarequal1) and assuming a constant temperature T.
__label__positive 8 demonstrates that when observed with a single bandpass, a com- posite disc spectrum of the form used in this work is practically indistinguishable from the spectrum of a single-temperature model.
__label__positive This also shows how our composite disc spectrum is consistent with both the X-ray and UV inferred temperatures of ASASSN-1 4 l i( B r o w ne ta l .
__label__positive If one ﬁts a sequence of standard Planckian proﬁles to an evolving narrow band TDE light curve, two time-dependent quantities canbe calculated: an evolving single temperature and emission radius.
__label__positive The latter is, in effect, an evolving overall normalization.
__label__positive one with slowly decayingmagnitude, F ν∼t−4n/7, equation 45) would then be interpreted by this procedure as a uniform temperature blackbody emission with a slowly shrinking radius.
__label__positive Very recently, a TDE-candidateASASSN-18jd (Neustadt et al.
__label__positive 2019 ) was observed showing exactly this feature, and was analysed by the technique we have described.
__label__positive In common with ASASSN-14li, ASASSN-18jd was discovered afteran∼120 d seasonal gap in observations, and appears to have already entered its UV plateau phase.
__label__positive The shallow decay of the UV light curve was interpreted by Neustadt et al.
__label__positive as a constant temperatureblackbody which is slowly contracting.
__label__positive We suggest here a second possible interpretation: that ASASSN-18jd may be another exampleof a TDE exhibiting an extended disc-dominated phase, and that this disc is cooling and expanding.
__label__positive Furthermore, van Velzen et al .(2019) surveyed a population of 8 TDEs detected at optical and UV wavelengths.
__label__positive They found evidence for a late-time UV plateau in the 6 best-observed TDEs in their sample, suggesting that the majority of TDEs undergo adisc-dominated phase.
__label__positive 4.9 Model limitations: a summary In common with all analytic models of TDE evolution, our model has necessarily been simpliﬁed in a number of ways.
__label__positive While we haveincluded general relativistic effects, we have neglected radiative transfer in the disc atmosphere.
__label__positive While these effects are likely to be small, it is of course possible that our best-ﬁtting model parameterswould be affected by their inclusion.
__label__positive The general properties of relativistic thin disc light curves are likely to be insensitive to this level of detail: the UV plateau results from the spreading andcooling of the disc on large scales, whilst the X-ray light curve is described by equation (60).
__label__positive The peak effective temperature T p could be somewhat modiﬁed to include a colour correction for Compton scattering, but the functional form itself will be unaltered: the explicit time dependence enters through the solution of the underlying disc equations.
__label__positive Further potential sources of spectral modiﬁcation could in prin- ciple arise from any irradiation of the disc by an external source(e.g.
__label__positive a jet), or even self-irradiation by disc photons which have been gravitationally deﬂected to such a degree that they illuminate the disc.
__label__positive (This ﬁnal effect becomes important if the angular momentumparameter of the black hole approaches unity.
__label__positive ) Finally, whilst it appears that the early-time non-disc emission is restricted to UV wavelengths, it is not possible to rule out the possibility that therecould be a non-thermal component at X-ray frequencies at the earliest times.
__label__positive A fundamental assumption of our model is that the disc is thin, and can therefore be described by the relativistic evolution equation (2).
__label__positive This assumption will breakdown if the ratio of the bolometric luminosity to the Eddington luminosity signiﬁcantly exceeds unity.This may be checked numerically.
__label__positive The bolometric luminosity is found by integrating the locally emitted ﬂux over the disc surface L bol(t)=2π/integraldisplay∞ rI(grrgφφ)1/2γφ(r,a)2σ/tildewideT4(r,t)dr.
__label__positive (82) For our best-ﬁtting black hole mass, M=1.85×106M⊙,t h e Eddington luminosity is LEdd=2.33×1044erg/s/similarequal5.9×1010L⊙.
__label__positive (83) The bolometric light curve of our best-ﬁtting disc model is shown in Fig.
__label__positive Whilst at the earliest times the disc luminosity approaches the Eddington limit, peaking at Lpeak/LEdd/similarequal0.85 (the blue dot corresponds with the time of the ﬁrst recorded ASASSN-14liobservation), the disc is found to be sub-Eddington thereafter.
__label__positive With a peak luminosity of L peak=0.85 LEdd, we note that corrections to the thin disc model need not be negligible, as the ‘slim disc’ regime isentered (Abramowicz et al.
__label__positive However, it is unlikely that such modiﬁcations will result in transformative changes in the observed light curves, as opposed to slightly altering our thin disc model ﬁts.Along with the effects of radiative transfer and radiatively coupled outﬂows, slim disc modelling represents a promising avenue for reﬁning the present treatment.

__label__positive 5) and two single colour blackbody spectrums (brown and yellow dashed curves), with ‘characteristic’ temperatures denoted on plot.
__label__positive Whenobserved through either optical or X-ray bands a composite spectrum of thesort studied in this paper is largely indistinguishable from that of a singlecolour spectrum.
__label__positive As was earlier suggested, both the small disc mass and the early- time UV ﬂux could result from a super-Eddington outﬂow, initiated at times predating the ﬁrst observation.
__label__positive If so, it is not a surprise thatthe disc luminosity at the earliest times is close to the Eddington lu- minosity.
__label__positive If representative of the wider TDE population, our results suggest that a relatively small fraction of the stellar debris eventuallysettles into a disc at radii close to the central black hole.
__label__positive This will be particularly true of discs formed from TDEs around lower mass black holes, which have both a lower Eddington luminositiesand larger bolometric luminosities for a given disc mass (note that the scaling relations for time-dependent discs differ from classical steady-state models, as in the former ˙Mis a dynamical variable).Figure 9.

__label__positive The peak of this light curve corresponds to abolometric luminosity of L peak/similarequal0.85LEdd.
__label__positive 4.10 Summary of numerical model In this section, we have determined best-ﬁtting disc light curves at several different wavelength bands for a relativistic thin discevolving with a ﬁnite ISCO stress.
__label__positive These model light curves are compared to the observed light curves of the tidal disruption event ASASSN-14li.
__label__positive By solving the fully relativistic thin-discequation (2) and performing ray-tracing calculations, this model includes strong gravity effects.
__label__positive 10shows the evolving emission in four different observational bands, three at UV wavelengthsand one corresponding to the Swift X-ray telescope 0.3–10 keV band.
__label__positive The dashed curves represent the contributions of the evolving disc to the emitted ﬂux.
__label__positive The solid lines represent a combineddisc and exponentially decaying component, only relevant at UV wavelengths.
__label__positive The evolving X-ray ﬂux is well described at all times by an evolving thin disc with a ﬁnite ISCO stress.
__label__positive The model requires no other spectral components and gives a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt to the observationsthan either the canonical Rees power-law model or an exponentially decaying model.
__label__positive The properties of this X-ray light curve are in good qualitative agreement with the analytical results of Section 3: the MNRAS 492, 5655–5674 (2020)Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/492/4/5655/5714123 by guest on 22 March 2023
__label__positive Spectral evolution of disc dominated TDEs 5667 Figure 10.
__label__positive Comparison of the best-ﬁtting disc light curves with the observed ASASSN-14li light curves at both X-ray (right scale) and UV (left scale) frequencies (UV data: Brown et al.
__label__positive The disc model light curves are shown by the dashed curves, at UV wavelengths there is an additional exponentially declining component at early times.
__label__positive All four disc light curves result from the same disc model w ith only four ﬁtted parameters.
__label__positive X-ray ﬂux of the disc model decays at a faster rate than that of a pure power law, but at a slower rate than a pure exponential decay.
__label__positive The UV emission of ASASSN-14li at the earliest times appears not to be the result of thermal emission from a turbulently evolving thin disc.
__label__positive Instead, it is dominated by a much more rapidly decaying, secondary component.
__label__positive After ∼200 d however, the ASASSN-14li UV ﬂux undergoes a 1000 d plateau, and is extremely well described by thin disc emission.
__label__positive This means that for approximately 1000 d of observations, the entirety of the ASASSN-14li emission at both UV and X-ray wavelengths can be successfully reproduced by a relativistic thindisc model with nine total parameters, of which only four are inferred from the observations.
__label__positive Our results demonstrate that while the behaviour of a TDE at its earliest times may be complex, the longterm observed properties of a TDE can be very well described by a simple relativistic thin disc with a ﬁnite ISCO stress.
__label__positive This suggests the exciting possibility that future modelling of well observed TDEswill be able to constrain the properties of a population of otherwise quiescent supermassive black holes.
__label__positive 5 PROPERTIES OF THE CENTRAL BLACK HOLE To analyse the effects of varying the black hole spin on the best- ﬁtting ASASSN-14li parameters, we investigate the disc evolution equation (2), along with ray-tracing calculations (8), for a variety of black hole spins.
__label__positive For each black hole spin we reﬁt the fourparameters t v,tD,M dandMto the X-ray light curve and late-time UV emission.
__label__positive Of these four parameters, the viscous time-scale tv, disc mass Mdand time offset tDare the most poorly constrained by theory or observations.
__label__positive For each black hole spin, we present in Table 3the best-ﬁtting black hole mass M, and the minimum reduced chi-squared ¯ χ2 minof the ﬁtted X-ray light curve (equation 76).Table 3.
__label__positive Best-ﬁtting black hole masses M and the minimum X-ray light curve reducedchi-squared ¯ χ 2 minfor different black hole spin parameters.
__label__positive a/rg M/M⊙ ¯χ2 min 0.9 2 .00+0.05 −0.1×1066.57 0.75 1 .93+0.03 −0.04×1066.15 0.5 1 .85+0.03 −0.04×1066.19 01 .66+0.06 −0.06×1066.40 −0.5 1 .62+0.08 −0.07×1066.49 −0.9 1 .55+0.1 −0.1×1066.61 The value of the minimum reduced chi-squared of the ﬁtted X-ray light curves is relatively insensitive to the black hole spin (Table 3).
__label__positive This is due to the fact that residual short-time-scale ﬂuctuations in the ASASSN-14li X-ray light curve dominate the model-data discrepancy.
__label__positive This is further compounded by an intrinsic parameter degeneracy between the black holes mass and spin.The peak temperature of a ﬁnite ISCO stress disc, which is the physically relevant temperature for the X-ray ﬂux (equation 60), depends strongly on the physical location of the ISCO.
__label__positive Increasingthe (prograde) rotation of the black hole reduces the ISCO location in units of r g, whereas increasing the black hole mass increases the magnitude of rgin physical units.
__label__positive This is reﬂected in the positive correlation of the best-ﬁtting black hole masses and spins (Table 3).
__label__positive With these caveats, a best-ﬁtting black hole spin lies in the range 0.5<a/rg<0.75.
__label__positive This is much more uncertain than other ﬁtted parameters.
__label__positive We can use the physically allowed spin range ( |a/rg|<1) to calculate bounds on the black hole mass.
__label__positive An important result of our MNRAS 492, 5655–5674 (2020)Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/492/4/5655/5714123 by guest on 22 March 2023
__label__positive Balbus analysis is that the central black hole mass of ASASSN-14li can be tightly constrained.
__label__positive Over the dimensionless spin range ( −0.9 <a/rg<0.9) considered here, (we do not extend this range to a/rg=±0.998 as the neglected returning radiation would become signiﬁcant in this limit) the best-ﬁtting black hole mass variesby only a factor of 1.3, varying from 1 .55×10 6M⊙for rapid retrograde rotation a/rg=−0.9, to 2 ×106M⊙for rapid prograde rotation a/rg=0.9.
__label__positive This best-ﬁtting mass range lies at the lower end of the range inferred from galactic bulge mass measurements (106.7±0.6M⊙, Mendel et al.
__label__positive 2014 ), but is in agreement with the mass inferred from velocity dispersion measurements ( M= 106.23±0.4M⊙,W e v e r se ta l .
__label__positive Previous estimates based on the observed ASASSN-14li light curves are much more in keeping with our ﬁndings, with Milleret al.
__label__positive ( 2015 ) inferring a black hole mass of M∼2×10 6M⊙based on Eddington limit arguments and the observed X-ray luminosity.
__label__positive Finally, our inferred mass range is also consistent with the QPObound published by Pasham et al.
__label__positive It therefore appears that very distinct modelling techniques are converging on to a single black hole mass for the ASASSN-14li system, of order M=2×106M⊙.
__label__positive 6 FINITE VERSUS V ANISHING ISCO STRESS 6.1 High-photon energy expansion If the stress vanishes at the ISCO, so too does the local disc temperature.
__label__positive This means that the hottest disc regions – those whichcontribute to the high energy Wien tail – take the geometric form of a ring at a disc radius exterior to the ISCO, within the body of the disc.
__label__positive To calculate the high-frequency spectrum in this case, wefollow Section 3.6 and expand the effective temperature about its maximum, assuming a face-on disc orientation.
__label__positive Now, the maximum temperature is now longer at the integration limit, and the expansiontakes the form 1 kB/tildewideT=1 kB/tildewideTp+1 2∂2 ∂R2/bracketleftbigg1 kB/tildewideT/bracketrightbigg Rp(R−Rp)2+...
__label__positive (84) We next deﬁne a dimensionless normalization parameter ξ≡R2 pkB/tildewideTp∂2 ∂R2/bracketleftbigg1 kB/tildewideT/bracketrightbigg Rp.
__label__positive (85) The leading order ﬂux integral is then Fν=4πhν o3 D2c2exp/parenleftBigg −hνo kB/tildewideTp/parenrightBigg ×/integraldisplay∞ −∞Rexp/bracketleftBigg −ξhν o 2kB/tildewideTp(R−Rp)2 Rp2/bracketrightBigg dR.

__label__positive (87) The X-ray luminosity is obtained by integrating this expression over the observer frequency band of interest.

__label__positive (88) As in Section 3.6, we assume a temperature time dependence of the form/tildewideTp∝τ−n/4.

__label__positive A comparison of the best-ﬁtting X-ray light curves from discs evolving with ﬁnite (blue) and vanishing (red) ISCO stresses, with theobserved X-ray light curve of ASASSN-14li (Bright et al.

__label__positive A disc with a ﬁnite ISCO stress produces a better ﬁt to the observed ASASSN-14li light curve.

__label__positive We remind the reader that for a vanishing ISCO stress, n>1.
__label__positive 11shows the best-ﬁtting X-ray light curve of a vanishing ISCO stress disc.
__label__positive This light curve was found with the same non- ﬁtted parameters of Section 4 (Table 2), except for the ISCO stress parameter γ, which is in effect inﬁnite for a vanishing ISCO stress (MB2).
__label__positive Next, the parameters of Table ( 1) were simultaneously ﬁt to the ASASSN-14li X-ray and UV light curves.
__label__positive The best-ﬁtting parameters for the vanishing ISCO stress disc are: M=1.8±0.1×106M⊙,Md=0.30±0.04 M ⊙,tv=400±20 d, andtD=110±10 d.
__label__positive The best-ﬁtting values for the vanishing ISCO stress disc are less certain than the ﬁnite ISCO stress disc as a result of the overall poorer ﬁt, ¯ χ2 vanishing stress =709.8/91.
__label__positive As can be seen in Fig.11, the best-ﬁtting vanishing and ﬁnite ISCO stress light curves are almost indistinguishable for the ﬁrst ∼300 d of observations, deviating only at later times.
__label__positive This late-time deviation is entirely aresult of the different luminosity power-law exponents associated with vanishing and ﬁnite ISCO stress discs.
__label__positive With a power-law exponent of n≈1.2, the late-time vanishing ISCO stress X-ray light curve becomes dominated by an F X∼t−0.45exp (−t0.3) time dependence.
__label__positive The correspondingly shallower decline of a ﬁnite ISCO stress X-ray light curve results from its n≈0.8 exponent, leading to an FX∼t−0.4exp (−t0.2) late-time proﬁle.
__label__positive It is the different exponents within the exponentials which are responsible for the late-time divergence of the two light curves.
__label__positive Since ASASSN-14li has been observed for ∼900 d, there are observations at sufﬁciently late times to differentiate between the two models.
__label__positive The X-ray light curve of ASASSN-14li is clearlybetter ﬁt with a disc evolving with a ﬁnite ISCO stress than a disc with a vanishing ISCO stress (Fig.
__label__positive 11), a distinction that can only be seen at times t>400 d, where the two models cleanly MNRAS 492, 5655–5674 (2020)Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/492/4/5655/5714123 by guest on 22 March 2023
__label__positive Spectral evolution of disc dominated TDEs 5669 Figure 12.
__label__positive The disc continuum spectrum, calculated from equation (11), shown at several different times (denoted on plot).
__label__positive The simultaneousproperties of both the (very shallow) UV and (rapidly declining) X-raydisc light curves can be simply understood from the evolution of the overallshape of the disc spectrum.
__label__positive An additional problem with the vanishing ISCO stress disc model is that to produce an acceptable X-ray ﬂux, the disc must be super-Eddington.
__label__positive The vanishing ISCO stress discs bolometricluminosity peaks at L peak=1.31LEdd,a n d L/LEdd>1 for the ﬁrst ∼250 d.
__label__positive Interestingly, late-time observations of evolving TDEs may be the best way to determine the nature of the ISCO boundary condition.
__label__positive 7 COMPARISON OF NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL CALCULATIONS We have seen that the results of the full numerical calculations of the evolving ASASSN-14li light curves are in good qualitative agreement with the analytical results of Section 3.
__label__positive In this section, we focus on a more quantitative comparison between numerical and analytical calculations.
__label__positive Not surprisingly, the behaviour of the ASASSN-14li light curves shows a strong dependence on observational band.
__label__positive The UV ﬂux undergoes a prolonged plateau, whilst the X-ray ﬂux declines both monotonically and rapidly.
__label__positive This behaviour can be understood bythe relative location of the observational bands with respect to the frequency of the peak of the continuum accretion disc spectrum (Fig.
__label__positive 12demonstrates, the UV bands probe frequencies smaller than peak of the disc spectrum.
__label__positive At these frequencies, the dual effects of a temporally decreasing peak intensity, coupled with the decline of the peak frequency itself leads to narrow bandobservations in which the disc ﬂux plateaus for prolonged periods.
__label__positive This is particularly pronounced in the UV observations of ASASSN- 14li (Fig.
__label__positive We emphasize that this UV light curve plateau should be a signature feature of all tidal disruption events which undergo an evolutionary phase dominated by disc emission.
__label__positive Once a TDEsystem has settled down into an evolving thin disc (after an initial phase of UV emission dominated by some non-thermal component), physically reasonable values of the parameters t v,M d and Mwill cause the disc spectral peak to lie at ‘extreme’ ultraviolet frequencies, which are much higher than the UV ob- servational bands.

__label__positive The solid line is from a numerical evaluation (Fig.
__label__positive 5); the dotted line is the large ν analytic result (equation 90).
__label__positive wide range of TDEs should therefore display UV light curve plateaus.
__label__positive 12, the observed ASASSN-14li X-ray ﬂux stems from the quasi-Wien tail of the disc spectrum.
__label__positive This allows for a detailed comparison between the high-photon-energy asymptotic expansions presented in Section 3 (equations 59 and 60), and thebest-ﬁtting numerical spectrum, and evolving X-ray light curve, of Section 4 (Figs 5and6).
__label__positive 13is a comparison between the high-photon-energy spectrum of the ﬁducial disc model (best-ﬁtting parameters from Table 1), and the functional form of the asymptotic expansion (equation 59).
__label__positive The observed ﬂux has been renormalizedfor display purposes, but the frequency dependence is of course unaltered.
__label__positive The asymptotic ﬂux expression F ν/similarequalν2exp(−hν/k BTp), (90) where Tpis the maximum effective temperature in the disc at the time of ﬁtting, is clearly an excellent ﬁt over the entire Swift XRT band.
__label__positive Yet more striking is a quantitative comparison between the math- ematical asymptotic expansion for the evolving X-ray light curve(equation 60) and both the observed X-ray ﬂux of ASASSN-14li, with the results of the full numerical disc model (Fig.
__label__positive It is only at the very earliest times that equation (60) and the full numericaldisc model deviate at all!
__label__positive This is due to the assumption that the peak of the effective temperature distribution occurs at the inner disc edge, something which is manifestly not satisﬁed in the fullnumerical disc model at early times (see Fig.
__label__positive Once the evolving disc reaches the ISCO the two results very quickly converge, and are then in excellent agreement for the entire 900 d of observations.The value of the bolometric decay index was taken to be n=0.8 during this ﬁtting procedure, a value which in conformance with time-dependent disc theory for a ﬁnite ISCO stress disc ( BM18 , MB1 ,MB2 ).
__label__positive Our results suggest that the observed X-ray light curves from disc-dominated TDE spectra should be well ﬁt by the following function, which is a high-energy asymptotic solution MNRAS 492, 5655–5674 (2020)Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/492/4/5655/5714123 by guest on 22 March 2023

__label__positive 8 CONCLUSIONS In this work, we have developed mathematical techniques, both numerical and analytical, to evaluate the emission proﬁles of a simple evolving relativistic thin disc.
__label__positive The effective temperature proﬁles are calculated on the basis of a recently developed 1D evolution equation for a disc in the Kerr geometry ( BM18 ,MB1 , MB2 ).
__label__positive At the ISCO, we have allowed for either a vanishing or ﬁnite value of the stress.
__label__positive The relativistic equation has much in common with its Newtonian counterpart.
__label__positive Indeed, the self-similar solutions of the Newtonian equation (of which there are two; Pringle 1991 ) serve as the foundation for understanding the properties of relativistic discs.Crucially, it is the properties of the disc in the region near the ISCO which inﬂuences the global disc behaviour at large times.
__label__positive A vanishing ISCO stress picks out the classical Newtonian solution atlate times, whereas a ﬁnite ISCO stress boundary condition results in the dominance of an outer disc solution which is ordinarily discarded.
__label__positive The results we have presented here are for the light curves of these solutions at observed UV and X-ray bandpasses.
__label__positive We have demonstrated that these light curves provide a signiﬁcantlyimproved ﬁt to the spectral data of ASASSN-14li, a particularly well-observed TDE, when compared to previous models.
__label__positive The calculated light curves of discs evolving with a ﬁnite ISCO stressprovide a better ﬁt than those of a vanishing ISCO stress.
__label__positive The analysis here is a more stringent test than previous work ( BM18 ) which focused on ﬁtting power-law indices.Our spectral modelling has been carried out in two complemen- tary ways.
__label__positive First, we have integrated the evolution equation (for the effective temperature) and evaluated the disc emission integralby direct numerical methods.
__label__positive Secondly, we have used asymptotic expansion techniques to obtain a simple analytic form for the X- ray ﬂux (equation 91), and determine general properties of theevolving UV ﬂux.
__label__positive A comparison between the observed light curves of ASASSN-14li, numerical calculation, and analytic formula are all in good agreement.
__label__positive Over 1000 d of simultaneous UV and X-rayobservations of ASASSN-14li are well ﬁt with a relativistic thin disc model with a ﬁnite stress at the ISCO.
__label__positive We believe that this work provides not only for a compelling ﬁt to a disc model, but a deeperunderstanding of the underlying evolution.
__label__positive The results discussed here should be broadly applicable at late times to any TDE whose spectrum is dominated by a disc.

__label__positive This metric has non-zero components g00,grr,gθθ,gφφ,g0φ=gφ0.
__label__positive Photon trajectories through the Kerr metric are characterized by two constants of motion, the angular momentum L, and energy E.
__label__positive These constants of motion are related to the photons 4-velocity uμby L=pφ=gφφuφ+gφ0u0, (A1) and E=−p0=−g00u0−g0φuφ.
__label__positive (A2) The photon 4-velocities uμare related to the co-ordinates xμand invariant line element d τby uμ=dxμ dτ.
__label__positive (A3) These two conservation laws can be re-written as equations of motion for the photon co-ordinates tandφ, explicitly: u0 E=dt dτ/prime=−lgφ0+gφφ gφφg00−g2 φ0, (A4)and uφ E=dφ dτ/prime=lg00+g0φ gφφg00−g2 φ0, (A5) where τ/prime≡Eτandl≡L/E.
__label__positive For the randθco-ordinates we use the geodesic equations d2r dτ/prime2=−/Gamma1r μνdxμ dτ/primedxν dτ/prime, (A6) and d2θ dτ/prime2=−/Gamma1θ μνdxμ dτ/primedxν dτ/prime, (A7) where /Gamma1μ νκ=/Gamma1μ κνare the Christoffel coefﬁcients for the Boyer– Lindquist Kerr metric.

__label__positive Photons propagating through the Kerr metric have an additional integral of motion, which arises due to the vanishing norm of the photons 4-velocity gμνdxμ dτ/primedxν dτ/prime=0.
__label__positive (A8) A2 Photon initial condition We assume a distant observer orientated at an inclination angle θobs from the disc plane at a distance D.
__label__positive We set-up an image plane perpendicular to the line of sight centred at φ=0( F i g .
__label__positive 1), with image plane Cartesian co-ordinates ( α,β).
__label__positive A photon at an image plane co-ordinate ( α,β) has a corresponding spherical-polar co- ordinate ( ri,θi,φi), given by (Psaltis & Johannsen 2012 ) ri=/parenleftbig D2+α2+β2/parenrightbig1/2, (A9) cosθi=r−1 i(Dcosθobs+βsinθobs), (A10) tanφi=α(Dsinθobs−βcosθobs)−1.
__label__positive (A11) The only photons which will contribute to the image have 3- momentum which is perpendicular to the image plane.

__label__positive The ﬁnal component of the photons initial 4-velocity, (d t/dτ/prime)obs, can then be found from the initial 3-velocity and 3-positioncomponents (equation A9–A14) by the use of equation (A8): g 00/parenleftbig u0 i/parenrightbig2+2gφ0u0 iuφ i+grr/parenleftbig ur i/parenrightbig2+gθθ/parenleftbig uθ i/parenrightbig2+gφφ/parenleftBig uφ i/parenrightBig2 =0, (A15) here the various metric components are evaluated at ( ri,θi,φi).

__label__positive These four equations, together with the deﬁnitions dr dτ/prime=ur, (A18) and dθ dτ/prime=uθ, (A19) completely specify the photons trajectory.
__label__positive We solve these six (A4– A7, A18, A19) coupled ﬁrst-order differential equations using a fourth-order Runge–Kutta integrator.
__label__positive The initial condition is that of a photon at the image plane with position and 4-velocity given byequations (A9)–(A15), this photon is then propagated backwards until it crosses the disc plane, at some radius r f.
__label__positive We employ a variable time-step δτ/prime, set as a ﬁxed fraction hof the fastest changing variable δτ/prime=h×min/bracketleftBigg r/parenleftbiggdr dτ/prime/parenrightbigg−1 ,θ/parenleftbiggdθ dτ/prime/parenrightbigg−1 ,φ/parenleftbiggdφ dτ/prime/parenrightbigg−1/bracketrightBigg .(A20) To determine the appropriate size of the ﬁxed step size hwe require a measure of the accuracy of the algorithm.
__label__positive The ﬁnal integral of motion (equation A8) is useful for this purpose.
__label__positive Errors propagating throughout the photons trajectory will cause the norm of the photons4-velocity to deviate from zero.
__label__positive We therefore deﬁne the parameter /Delta1by /Delta1=1+/bracketleftbigg g rr/parenleftbiggdr dτ/prime/parenrightbigg2 +gθθ/parenleftbiggdθ dτ/prime/parenrightbigg2 +gφφ/parenleftbiggdφ dτ/prime/parenrightbigg2 +2gφ0/parenleftbiggdt dτ/prime/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggdφ dτ/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg/slashbigg g00/parenleftbiggdt dτ/prime/parenrightbigg2 , (A21) which would satisfy /Delta1=0 for an error free integration.
__label__positive We set the ﬁxed step size hby requiring that /Delta1< 10−7, (A22) for all photon trajectories.
__label__positive This was found empirically to be satisﬁed by h=5×10−3.
__label__positive (A23) A4 Photon redshift and the observed spectrum The observed disc spectrum Fνis given by the double integral Fν=1 D2/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Sf3Bν(νo/f , T )dαdβ, (A24) where the disc temperature T(r,t) is given by equation (4), and the photon redshift factor fis given by f=νo νe=1 U0/bracketleftbigg 1+pφ p0/Omega1/bracketrightbigg−1 .
__label__positive (A25)Here U0and/Omega1=Uφ/U0are 4-velocity components of the rotating disc ﬂuid, and pφand p0are photon 4-momentum components.
__label__positive The ratio pφ/p0is a constant of motion for a photon propagating through the Kerr metric, and is equal to −lin the notation of our algorithm.
__label__positive As a conserved quantity, lcan be calculated from the initial conditions and equations (A1) and (A2).
__label__positive The quantities U0 and/Omega1are functions of the black hole spin a, and the radius at which the photon was emitted.
__label__positive This radius corresponds to the end point ofthe ray-tracing algorithm r f.
__label__positive Starting from a ﬁnely spaced grid of points ( α,β) in the image plane, we trace the geodesics of each photon back to the disc plane,recording ( r f,l) for each photon.
__label__positive The parameter rfallows the disc temperature Tto be calculated at a given time t(equation 4).
__label__positive The parameters rfand ltogether uniquely deﬁne the redshift factor f.
__label__positive The integrand f3Bν(νo/f,T) can therefore be calculated at every grid point in the image plane.
__label__positive The integral (A24) was then calculated using a two-dimensional Simpsons algorithm.
__label__positive APPENDIX B: FITTING PROCEDURE AND PARAMETER DEGENERACIES We ﬁt four free parameters to the observed ASASSN-14li light curves: the time offset tD, the viscous time-scale tv, the disc mass Md, and the black hole mass M.
__label__positive The time offset and viscous time-scale of the evolving disc are constrained by minimizing the reduced chi-squared of the ASASSN-14li X-ray light curve, which is strongly time varying.
__label__positive Unlike the temporal parameters, the blackhole and disc masses cannot be constrained by either the X-ray or UV observations separately.
__label__positive The black hole and disc masses may be constrained, however, by simultaneously ﬁtting the UV and X-ray light curves.
__label__positive Figs B2 andB4demonstrate that disc parameters which equally well ﬁt the UV band light curve, produce X-ray light curves which differ fromthe observed ﬂuxes by orders of magnitude, and vice versa.
__label__positive Fitting separately to the UV and X-ray bands produce two different curves between disc and black hole mass, their unique intersection allowsboth to the determined (Fig.
__label__positive To ﬁt the black hole and disc masses we minimized the reduced chi-squared of the X-ray light curve, subject to the constraint that the late-time UV ﬂux plateaumust have the correct magnitude.
__label__positive Best-ﬁtting X-ray light curves for different black hole masses, ignoring the late-time ASASSN-14li UV data.
__label__positive The difﬁculty in tightlyconstraining system parameters exclusively with the X-ray data is evident.Black hole masses for each curve are shown.

__label__positive The disc light curves in the UVW1 band produced by the degenerate X-ray light curve parameters of Fig.
__label__positive Although the X-ray light curves are completely degenerate, the corresponding UVW1 ﬂuxessigniﬁcantly differ from the observed values except for narrow ranges of theblack hole mass.
__label__positive is a more extensive data set with more complex temporal structure, and is therefore more constraining.
__label__positive Fluctuations in the data mean that our best-ﬁtting X-ray light curve still has a large reduced chi-squared, which makes estimatingthe error ranges on our best-ﬁtting parameters problematic.
__label__positive Once a best ﬁt had been found, our approach has been to formally enlarge the quoted error bars on the X-ray data (thereby accounting for theﬂuctuations in a statistical sense) by a constant factor until the best ﬁt reduced chi-squared is equal to unity.
__label__positive Using this manipulated data, the quoted error ranges are found by computing the /Delta1χ 2=3 contours of the X-ray light curves, while ensuring that the late-time UV ﬂux was correctly reproduced.
__label__positive These should be considered very conservative error ranges.
__label__positive Best-ﬁtting UVW1 light curves for different black hole masses, ignoring the ASASSN-14li X-ray data.
__label__positive The black hole masses for each curveare denoted on the plot.
__label__positive Like the X-ray light curves, the late-time UVW1light curves of ASASSN-14li can individually be ﬁt by a wide range ofsystem parameters.Figure B4.

__label__positive The best-ﬁtting disc mass as a function of black hole mass for individual light curve ﬁts to the UVW1 band (blue curve) and X-rayband (red curve).
__label__positive The parameter dependencies have opposite trends for the different light curves, meaning that we can tightly constrain the system parameters by using both sets of data.
__label__positive The errors bars on the ASASSN-14liparameters are representative of the error bars on all the points.
__label__positive APPENDIX C: EDGE ON VIEWER ORIENTATION We require the asymptotic expansions of the integrals I(ﬂux integral) and J(luminosity integral), where I=/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Sexp(−hνo/kB/tildewideT)dαdβ, (C1) and J=/integraldisplay∞ νlIdνo.

__label__positive Balbus In particular, we are interested in the properties of the solutions in the limit hνl/greatermuchkB/tildewideT, (C4) when the disc is observed at an angle θobsnot close to face-on.
__label__positive When a relativistic disc is observed at angles close to edge-on, the largerotational velocities in the innermost disc regions result in strong Doppler blue shifting of the observed photons emergent from one half of the disc, and similarly strong doppler red shifting of the remaining photons.
__label__positive Therefore, the frequency ratio function f(α,β) will peak strongly about a ‘hotspot’ surrounding the most stronglyblueshifted material.
__label__positive We must therefore modify the asymptotic expansion techniques of Sections 3.6 and 6.1 to take account of this different observing geometry.
__label__positive We deﬁne the relevant function K(α,β,t )≡hν o kB/tildewideT, (C5) and proceed to expand Kabout the co-ordinates of the discs hotspot (α,β)=(X0,Y0), where /tildewideTp≡/tildewideT(X0,Y0)=max[/tildewideT(α, β)].
__label__positive (C6) The exact form of the expansion will then depend on the nature of the ISCO stress.
__label__positive Crucially for our purposes, the leading order termin the expansion will have time dependence as in Section 3.6 K 0≡hνl kB/tildewideTp∝tn/4.
__label__positive (C7) Finally, the effects of gravitational lensing of the observed inner disc geometry will be accounted for with dαdβ=F(X,Y )dXdY, (C8) here Fis an unspeciﬁed function of coordinates (but, importantly, notν)a n dd XdYthe local area element (Balbus 2014 ).
__label__positive C1 Finite ISCO stress – hotspot on an inner boundary If the stress is ﬁnite at the ISCO, then the disc temperature proﬁle will peak at its innermost edge.
__label__positive The leading order expansion of K is then given by K=K0+KX(X−X0)+1 2KYY(Y−Y0)2+...
__label__positive (C9) where Xand Yhave been appropriately chosen so that any cross- terms vanish.
__label__positive A subscript XorYhere denotes a partial derivate with respect to the relevant variable, with all other variables held constant.
__label__positive The spectrum integral is then I=exp(−K0)/integraldisplay∞ −∞/integraldisplay∞ X0F(X,Y )e x p [−KX(X−X0)] ×exp/bracketleftbigg −1 2KYY(Y−Y0)2/bracketrightbigg dXdY, (C10) which has a leading order solution I=F(X0,Y0)X0Y0 ξXhνo/radicalBigg 2π ξYYhνo(kB/tildewideTp)3/2exp(−hνo/kB/tildewideTp).
__label__positive (C11)Here, we have deﬁned magnitude constants ξX≡X0KX,ξ YY≡Y2 0KYY.
__label__positive (C12) The leading order luminosity integral then simply follows J∝(kB/tildewideTp)−5/2exp(−hνl/kB/tildewideTp), (C13) J∝t−5n/8exp(−(t/tX)n/4), (C14) with, for a ﬁnite ISCO stress disc, n/similarequal0.8.
__label__positive The only difference resulting from changing the disc orientation from face-on to edge-on is a slight modiﬁcation to the leading power-law exponent, from 4n/8 (face-on) to 5 n/8 (edge-on).
__label__positive C2 Vanishing ISCO stress – exterior hotspot As in Section 6.1, when the disc stress vanishes at the ISCO, the disc temperature maximum occurs at a disc radius exterior to the ISCO.
__label__positive The relevant expansion is then (employing the same subscript notation as above) K=K 0+1 2KXX(X−X0)2+1 2KYY(Y−Y0)2+...
__label__positive (C15) This results in a leading order ﬂux integral I=exp(−K0)/integraldisplay∞ −∞/integraldisplay∞ −∞F(X,Y ) ×exp/bracketleftbigg −1 2(KXX(X−X0)2+KYY(Y−Y0)2)/bracketrightbigg dXdY, (C16) w h i c hi ss o l v e dt og i v e I=F(X0,Y0)X0Y0/radicalBigg 2π ξXXhνo/radicalBigg 2π ξYYhνo ×(kB/tildewideTp)−1exp(−hνo/kB/tildewideTp), (C17) whereξ XX≡X2 0KXX,ξ YY≡Y2 0KYY.
__label__positive (C18) The leading order luminosity integral then follows simply: J∝(kB/tildewideTp)−2exp(−hνl/kB/tildewideTp), (C19) J∝t−n/2exp(−(t/tX)n/4), (C20) with n/similarequal1.2 for a vanishing ISCO stress disc.
__label__positive As for a ﬁnite ISCO stress disc, modifying the disc-observer orientation angleonly results in a slightly changed leading power-law exponent.

__label__positive Introduction One of the foundations upon which modern astrophysics rests is the fundamental properties of stars throughout theirevolution.
__label__positive The advent of transformative capabilities in space-and ground-based hardware instruments is providing an unprecedented volume of high-quality measurements of stars, signiﬁcantly strengthening and extending the observational data upon which all of stellar astrophysics ultimately depends.For example, the Parker Solar Probe will provide new information on the ﬂow of energy, structure, and dynamics of the closest star (Parker 1958a ; Feng et al.
__label__positive Inouye Solar Telescope will provide high temporal and spatial resolution with adaptive optics to reveal the nature of the outer layers of the Sun (Parker 1958b ; McComas et al.
__label__positive The exceptional precision of stellar brightness measurements achieved by the planet-hunting space telescopes Kepler /K2 (Borucki et al.
__label__positive 2009 )ushered in a new era in stellar photometric variability investigations.
__label__positive The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite is building on this legacy by surveying most of the sky in roughly month-long sectors covering four 24 °×24°areas from the ecliptic poles to near the ecliptic plane (Ricker et al.
__label__positive The mission will produce light curves for about 200,000 nearby late-type stars sampled at a 2-minute cadence to open anew era of stellar variability exploration (e.g., Ball et al.

__label__positive complement these surveys by providing a unique, large sample of high-precision photometric monitoring of selected bright target stars (Broeg et al.
__label__positive TheGaia Data Release 2, containing about 1.7 billion stars, begins the process of converting the spectrophotometricmeasurements to distances, proper motions, luminosities, effective temperatures, surface gravities, and elemental com- positions (Bailer-Jones et al.
__label__positive This stellar census will revolutionize a range of questions related to the origin, structure, and evolutionary history of stars in the MilkyWay (e.g., Gaia Collaboration et al.
__label__positive The infrared instruments aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (Gardner et al.
__label__positive 2015 )will search for the ﬁrst- and second-generation stars (Rydberg et al.
__label__positive 2018 ), assess how galaxies evolved from their formation (Zackrisson et al.
__label__positive 2011 ), observe the formation of stars from the initial stages of collapse onward (Senarath et al.
__label__positive 2018 ), and measure the physical and chemical properties of stellar –planetary systems (Deming et al.
__label__positive The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Virgo interferometers have demonstrated the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems (Abbott et al.
__label__positive 2017d , 2017e ,2017f )and neutron star mergers (Abbott et al.
__label__positive 2017a , 2017b ,2017c )and will continue to monitor the sky with improved broadband detectors for gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals and asymmetrical explodingmassive stars.
__label__positive In partnership with this ongoing explosion of activity in stellar astrophysics, community-driven software instruments are transforming how stellar theory, modeling, and simulations interact with observations (e.g., Turk et al.
__label__positive Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA )was introduced in Paxton et al.
__label__positive (2011, hereafter Paper I)and signi ﬁcantly expanded its range of capabilities in Paxton et al.
__label__positive These prior papers, as well as this one, are software instrument papers that describe the capabilities and limitations of MESA while also comparing to other available numerical or analytic results.
__label__positive This instrument paper describes the major new advances to MESA for variable stars, numerical energy conservation, rotation, and convective boundaries.
__label__positive We do not fully explore the science results and their implications in this paper.
__label__positive The scienti ﬁc potential of these new capabilities will be unlocked in future work via the efforts of the growing, 1000-strong MESA research community.
__label__positive Millions of variable stars have been discovered in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds, the Local Group (e.g., Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment [OGLE ], Udalski et al.
__label__positive Figure 1shows the broad classi ﬁcations of these pulsating stars.
__label__positive Pulsating stars such as RR Lyrae and the brighter δCephei (the classical Cepheids )are common, and a strong direct relationship between their luminosities and pulsationperiods established Cepheids (Leavitt 1908; Freedman et al.
__label__positive 2016,2018 )and RR Lyrae in infrared bands (Clementini et al.
__label__positive New classes of variable stars are still beingdiscovered: blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs )are a new family of pulsating variable stars (Pietrukowicz et al.
__label__positive BLAPs are rare; only 14 variable stars are attributed by OGLE tothis class after examining ;10 9stars.
__label__positive They vary in brightness by ;20% on;30-minute timescales (Pietrukowicz et al.
__label__positive 2013 ).A n important new addition to MESA is the capability to model radially pulsating variable stars.
__label__positive Numerical energy conservation is rarely discussed by stellar evolution software instrument papers, or shown in science papers as part of establishing robustness of the solutionsobtained with the software instrument.
__label__positive Yet stellar evolution calculations generally use low-order, implicit time integration with potentially poorly conditioned matrices whose matrixelements contain limited-precision partial derivatives that can severely limit the quality of solutions.
__label__positive The cumulative effect of such errors can be substantial (Reiter et al.
__label__positive 1995 ).W e implement a set of changes in MESA that, when applicable, can signi ﬁcantly improve the energy conservation properties of stellar evolution models at both global and local levels.
__label__positive This can reduce cumulative errors in energy conservation to 1% orless for applications such as the evolution of a 1 M emodel Figure 1.

__label__positive Rotation modi ﬁes a star ʼs structure (von Zeipel 1924a ; Maeder & Meynet 2000; Tassoul 2000 ).
__label__positive We present a new approach in MESA for calculating the factors that modify the pressure and temperature equations of stellar structure withinthe shellular approximation.
__label__positive A rotating star is also oblate, with a larger radius at its equator than at its poles.
__label__positive As a result, the equator has a lower surface gravity and thus a lower effectivetemperature T eff (von Zeipel 1924b ; Chandrasekhar 1933 ).
__label__positive Hence, the equator is “gravity darkened, ”the poles are “gravity brightened, ”and this effect can play an important role in the classi ﬁcation of stars.
__label__positive The new extensions to MESA open a pathway for correcting TeffandLfor aspect-dependent effects.
__label__positive Stars transport energy by convection, whether within a core, within an envelope, or throughout the interior.
__label__positive These convec-tion regions showcase the interplay between composition mixing, gradients, and diffusion and the transport of energy through the radial exchange of matter.
__label__positive It is necessary to ensurethat convective boundaries are properly positioned because their placement can strongly in ﬂuence the evolution of the stellar model (Gabriel et al.
__label__positive We implement an improved algorithm for correctly locating the convective boundaries and naturally allowing the emergence of adiabatic semiconvection regions during core H and He burning.
__label__positive Section 2introduces a new capability to model large-amplitude radially pulsating variable stars.

__label__positive Later, radiation hydrodynamic treatments followed with implicit adaptive grids(Dorﬁ& Drury 1987; Dor ﬁ& Feuchtinger 1991 ).
__label__positive While these purely radiative models qualitatively reproduced light and radial velocity curves, it was clear that convection driven bypartial ionization of H and He carries most of the ﬂux in the envelopes of RR Lyrae and Cepheids.
__label__positive Prescriptions for coupling convection with pulsations were developed (e.g., Stellingwerf 1982; Kuhfuß, 1986 )that reside, with modi ﬁca- tions, in modern software instruments (Bono & Stellingwerf 1994; Yecko et al.
__label__positive Models from these software instruments can reproduce the overall morphology of light and radial velocity curves of classical pulsators (e.g., Feuchtinger et al.
__label__positive 2015 ), features of speci ﬁc objects (e.g., Keller & Wood 2006; Marconi et al.
__label__positive 2013 ), and dynamical phenomena such as the Hertzsprung progression (e.g., Hertzsprung 1926; Bono et al.
__label__positive Unsolved problems include double-mode pulsations (Kolláth et al.
__label__positive 2002; Smolec & Moskalik 2010 )and the cyclic modulations of RR Lyrae light curves (e.g., the Blazhko effect; Bla žko1907; Szabó et al.
__label__positive For background material we refer the reader to Gautschy & Saio (1995,1996 ), Buchler (2009 ), and Marconi (2017 ).
__label__positive Radial Stellar Pulsations —RSP RSP is a new functionality in MESAstar that models large- amplitude, self-excited, nonlinear pulsations that stars develop when they cross instability domains in the H-R diagram (see Figure 1).RSP is closely integrated with the MESA environ- ment.
__label__positive Instead of calling the standard MESAstar routine to evaluate equations and solve for a new model using Newton – Raphson iterations (see Section 3), a separate routine does the same for RSP using a different set of equations and a differentNewton –Raphson solver.
__label__positive The different equations include time- dependent convection in a form appropriate for modelingnonlinear pulsations, and the different solver uses a band diagonal matrix approach since the equations as currently implemented do not ﬁt into a three-block stencil needed for the standard block tridiagonal solver.
__label__positive Moreover, instead of callingthe usual MESAstar routine to get a starting model, a separate routine creates an RSP model envelope that is consistent with theRSP set of equations.
__label__positive RSP uses the same MESA opacity and EOS modules, inlist structure, pro ﬁle and history output ﬁles, photo ﬁles for saving and restarting runs, run_star _extras extensions, and hooks for using externally supplied routines.
__label__positive RSP follows Smolec & Moskalik ( 2008 ), where the momentum and speci ﬁc internal energy equations are () ( ) =-¶ ¶++ +-Du Dt mpp p UGm r,1t av q2 () [ ( ) ] ( )++ = -¶ ¶+-De DtppDV Dt mFF C ,2av rc where DDtis the Lagrangian time derivative.

__label__positive The diffusion approximation is used for the radiative ﬂuxFr, and its numerical implementation follows Stellingwerf (1975 ).
__label__positive Num- erical implementation of the superadiabatic gradient followsStellingwerf (1982 ).
__label__positive All equations are discretized on a Lagrangian mesh.
__label__positive For the momentum equation these are the turbulent pressure p t(Table 1 lists the relationship with the speci ﬁc turbulent energy et)and viscous momentum transfer rate Uq.
__label__positive For the turbulent energy equation these are the work done by turbulent pressure, the divergence of the turbulent ﬂuxFt, and the viscous energy transfer rate òq.
__label__positive The convective coupling term C=S−D−Drappears with opposite sign in the internal a nd turbulent energy equations.
__label__positive Generation of the turbulent energy is driven by the source function S, while turbulent dissipation Dand radiative cooling Dr contribute to its decay.
__label__positive Radiativ e cooling of convective eddies follows Wuchterl & Feuchtinger (1998 ).
__label__positive Details of the turbulent convection model are discussed in Kuhfuß (1986 ), Wuchterl & Feuchtinger (1998 ), and Smolec & Moskalik (2008 ).
__label__positive These terms in the convection model depend on the free parameters listed in Table 3.
__label__positive If radiative cooling and turbulent pressure are neglected, the ti me-independent version of the Kuhfuß (1986 )convection model reduces to standard mixing- length theory (MLT )provided that base values are used for αs, αc,a n d αd(associated controls set to 1 ).B a s ev a l u e sf o r αpandγr follow Yecko et al.

__label__positive Experience suggests that αt;0.01, αm1, and α2 are useful starting choices.
__label__positive Periods of pulsation modes depend weakly on the values of these free parameters.
__label__positive Pulsation growth rates and light and radial velocity curves are, however, sensitive to the freeparameters.
__label__positive Calibration with multiple observational constraints is unlikely to yield a unique set of parameters that gives satisfactory results across the H-R diagram for all pulsationmodes.
__label__positive We stress that parameter surveys are an essential part of any science application of RSP.
__label__positive In Equations (1)and (2),p avis the arti ﬁcial viscosity pressure (Richtmyer 1957 )for numerically handling shocks that may develop during pulsations.
__label__positive We adopt the Stellingwerf (1975 )two-parameter formulation as the default.
__label__positive The Tschar- nuter & Winkler (1979 )artiﬁcial pressure-tensor form, which was implemented in Paper III, can also be used in RSP.
__label__positive The numerical scheme to solve discrete versions of the equations is based on the intrinsically energy-conservingmethod given by Fraley (1968 ).
__label__positive Details of the numerical implementation, along with RSP ʼs lineage (Stellingwerf 1975; Kovacs & Buchler 1988 ), are discussed in Smolec & Moskalik (2008 ).
__label__positive During the nonlinear integration, u=0,L=constant, ande t=0 at the inner boundary (See Figure 2).
__label__positive The latter condition holds also for the outermost boundary, i.e., theoutermost cell is radiative.
__label__positive 2.2.RSP in Action RSP performs three operations: building an initial model, conducting a linear nonadiabatic (LNA )stability analysis on that model, and integrating the time-dependent nonlinear equations.
__label__positive Building an Initial Model Since the energy density of radial pulsations drops rapidly going inward from a star ʼs surface, a full stellar model reaching to the center is frequently not necessary.
__label__positive The use of RSP is currently restricted to cases in which pulsations are determined by the structure of the envelope and are independent of thedetailed structure of the core.
__label__positive RSP begins by building a chemically homogeneous envelope from given stellar para- meters (M,L,T eff,X, and Z).
__label__positive These parameters can be freely chosen and need not originate from a MESAstar model.
__label__positive It is not yet possible to directly import an envelope from MESAstar into RSP primarily because of the different treatments of convection (a version of MLT in MESAstarvs.
__label__positive Tighter integration of MESAstar andRSP is a future project.
__label__positive Speci ﬁcations for the initial model include the number of cells and the temperature at the base (see Figure 2).
__label__positive This inner boundary temperature is de ﬁned by a chosen temperature (RSP_T_inner ;2×106K)that should be set hot enough so that the eigenvector amplitudes generated in the followingstability analysis go to zero and cool enough to exclude regions of nuclear burning and justify the assumption of chemical homogeneity.
__label__positive The model is divided into inner and outer regionsat a speci ﬁed anchor temperature.
__label__positive In the outer region, cells have the same mass; in the inner region cell masses grow by a constant factor so that the innermost cells are signi ﬁcantly larger than the ones at the surface.
__label__positive The anchor temperature should be in the part of the model driving the pulsations.
__label__positive For example, for pulsations in the classical instability strip a valueofT anchor =11,000 K is typical.
__label__positive In the case of Z-bump pulsations a higher temperature would be appropriate.
__label__positive Proper choice of the number of outer cells and placement of the anchorare necessary to ensure that the driving region is well resolved.
__label__positive The initial model builder iteratively constructs an envelope in hydrostatic equilibrium that satis ﬁes the RSP equations.
__label__positive Starting from the outer radius determined by LandT eff, this process involves selection of a cell mass to be used in the outer part of the envelope and a scale factor that is used to progressively increase cell masses in the inner region.
__label__positive Thosechoices must match the desired number of cells, both Nand N outer, and also satisfy the surface boundary conditions and the required temperatures at the anchor location and at the innerboundary.
__label__positive The model builder is a complex multistage iterative procedure that works well for the range of cases presented in the following but may fail when applied outside of that range.Table 3 Free Parameters of the RSP Convection Model, Their Base Values, and Associated MESA Controls That Multiply the Base Values Parameter = Base Value × Control Value α 1 RSP_alfa αm 1 RSP_alfam αs ()12 23 RSP_alfas αc ()12 23 RSP_alfac αd ()83 23 RSP_alfad αp 2/3 RSP_alfap αt 1 RSP_alfat γr 23 RSP_gammar Figure 2.
__label__positive The inner boundary at the base of the static envelope is de ﬁned by a chosen temperature (RSP_T_inner ).
__label__positive The model surface has a ﬁxed temperature Touter, derived from Teff, and pressure (RSP_Psurf ).
__label__positive The anchor temperature (RSP_T_anchor )is usually located where H ionizes, shown by the blue curve.
__label__positive The envelope is divided into N Lagrangian mass cells (RSP_nz).
__label__positive Between the anchor and the surface are Nouter cells (RSP_nz_outer ), each with a constant mass.
__label__positive Between the inner boundary and the anchor the mass of each cell increases.
__label__positive 5The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 243:10 (44pp ), 2019 July Paxton et al.
__label__positive Stability Analysis The LNA analysis is performed on the initial model using a full linearization of the RSP equations (for details see Smolec 2009 ).
__label__positive These include time-dependent convection, moving beyond the frozen-in convection approximation madein software instruments like GYRE .
__label__positive This yields the eigenmodes, periods, and growth rates.
__label__positive The eigenvectors are used to perturb the initial model for the time evolution.
__label__positive Figure 3shows amplitudes of radial displacements and differential work for the ﬁrst three eigenmodes of the classical Cepheid model in the MESA test _suite .
__label__positive A common resolution for exploratory model surveys, N=150 and N outer =40, is adopted.
__label__positive For T5×105K, the displacements and differential work of all three radial eigenmodes are negligible, indicating that the extent of the computationaldomain is suf ﬁcient.
__label__positive Evolution in the Linear Regime The initial static model is perturbed with a linear combination of the velocity eigenvectors of the three lowest-order radial modes.
__label__positive More speci ﬁcally, the velocity eigenvectors are scaled to have a surface value of 1.
__label__positive RSP_fraction _1st_overtone andRSP_fraction _2nd_overtone multiply the 1O and 2O eigenvectors, respectively.
__label__positive The F-mode eigenvector is then multiplied by (1-RSP _fraction _1st_overtone -RSP_fraction _2nd_overtone ).
__label__positive The linear combination of these three scaled eigenvecto rs is then multiplied by the surface velocity RSP_kick _vsurf _km_per_sec.
__label__positive The time integration commences with a constant time step (RSP_target _steps _per_cycle )and continues for a speciﬁed number of pulsation cycles (RSP_max_num_per- iods ).
__label__positive A new cycle begins when the model passes through a maximum radius.
__label__positive Controls allow ﬁltering out secondary maxima in the radial velocity curve.
__label__positive Figure 4shows Γ, the fractional growth of the kinetic energy per pulsation period near the start of a time integration, where () () ( )G= - +++EEEE2, 5iiii k,max1 k,max k,max1 k,maxandEi k,max is the maximum kinetic energy of the envelope during pulsation cycle i.
__label__positive Agreement between these three time integrations and the corresponding LNA analyses is satisfac-tory.
__label__positive Similarly, the pulsation periods match the linear values during the low-amplitude phase of development.
__label__positive Consistency between the time integrations and LNA analyses forms thebasis for interpreting the nonlinear results.
__label__positive Different Perturbations, Different Periods Which of the perturbed modes attains large-amplitude pulsa- tions in the nonlinear regime may depend on the initial conditions (e.g., Smolec 2014 ).F i g u r e 5shows the results of longer time integrations for the RR Lyrae model shown in Figure 4.T h e upper triplet of panels, case (a), is for a 1O-mode initialization with a 4.5 km s−1amplitude.
__label__positive The middle triplet panel, case (b),i s for an F-mode initialization with 4.5 km s−1amplitude.
__label__positive The lower triplet, case (c), is for an F-mode initialization with a 9.5 km s−1 amplitude.
__label__positive For case (a), the pulsations converge toward a single, 1O-mode pulsation.
__label__positive After a ;500-cycle transient phase, the pulsation period and radius amplitude barely change and Γ;0.
__label__positive For case (b), the model has not converged to a single- periodic mode after 4000 cycles.
__label__positive Despite the pure F-mode initialization, at ;300 cycles the pulsation switches toward the 1O-mode.
__label__positive This does not prove that the model cannot pulsate inthe F-mode, as case (c)demonstrates.
__label__positive After a transient phase with beating F and 1O-modes, the 1O-mode decays and the single-periodic F-mode pulsation grows to saturation.
__label__positive Figure 5is an example of two different single-mode solutions whose selection depends on the initial conditions.
__label__positive Two stars can have the same physical parameters but pulsate in different modes depending on their evolutionary history.
__label__positive Convection Parameter Sensitivity Theﬁnal state in the nonlinear regime is usually a single- periodic oscillation.
__label__positive The shape of the light and radial velocity curves may depend on the values of the eight free parameters listed in Table 3.
__label__positive In Table 4setA corresponds to the simplest convection model.
__label__positive Set B adds radiative cooling, set C adds turbulent pressure and turbulent ﬂux, and set D includes these effects simultaneously.
__label__positive The parameter αmhas little effect on the shape of the light curve but strongly affects its amplitude.Figure 3.
__label__positive Shown are the displacement amplitudes (black )and the differential work (red )done by the lowest three radial eigenmodes.
__label__positive The thickest curves are for the fundamental (F) mode, medium thickness for the ﬁrst overtone (1O )mode, and the thinnest curves for the second overtone (2O )mode.
__label__positive The gray areas show the extent of the convection zones around Hionization, ﬁrst He and second He ionization, respectively.Figure 4.
__label__positive Comparison of the fractional growth rate Γduring the initial cycles of the time integration.
__label__positive An RR Lyrae model (M=0.65 Me,L=45Le,Teff=7100 K, X=0.75, Z= 0.0014 )was initialized with a 0.1 km s−1amplitude pure F-mode (circles ), 1O- mode (squares ), or 2O-mode (triangles )and evolved.
__label__positive 6The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 243:10 (44pp ), 2019 July Paxton et al.
__label__positive Figure 6shows the effect of varying αmon the Teff=6000 K Cepheid model.
__label__positive The free parameter αmmay thus be used to match the observed amplitude.
__label__positive For sets A –D,αmwas adjusted so that models with different sets have similar amplitudes.Figure 7shows the effect of these parameter sets on the shapes of the bolometric light, photosphere radial velocity, andradius variation curves for a saturated F-mode RR Lyrae and two saturated F-mode classical Cepheid models.
__label__positive The pulsationperiods, radial velocity curves, and radius variation curvesshow only small differences.
__label__positive For the RR Lyrae models, there are differences in the ﬁne structure of the light curves.
__label__positive For example, the bump before minimum light is weaker whenturbulent pressure and turbulent ﬂux are included (sets C and D).
__label__positive The shape of the light curve near maximum light also differs for both the RR Lyrae and Cepheid models.
__label__positive Figure 8shows the convective luminosity pro ﬁles for the models of Figure 7.
__label__positive Depending on pulsation phase, one convective region (darker hues )extends from the surface cells d o w nt oc e l l ;90.
__label__positive This convective reg ion is associated with partial ionization of H and H e.
__label__positive Another convective region (lighter hues )lies deeper in the envelope, centered at cell ;110, and is associated with the second ionization of He.
__label__positive In most of the modelsthese two convective regions merge at pulsation phase ;0.5 during maximum contraction when both convective regions are attheir strongest and most extended.
__label__positive In the cooler models, the ﬁrst convective region carries nearly all of the luminosity throughout a pulsation cycle.
__label__positive In the hotter models, this convective regionbecomes very weak at pulsation phase ;0.8 (before maximum expansion )and is barely resolved as it progresses deeper into the envelope.
__label__positive This behavior is pronounced in the RR Lyrae models with radiative cooling (sets B and D ), as cooling contributes to damping the turbulent energy and hence the near disappearance ofthe convective region.

__label__positive 7The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 243:10 (44pp ), 2019 July Paxton et al.
__label__positive Arti ﬁcial Viscosity Sensitivity There are two parameters, αcutand Cq, that control the Stellingwerf (1975 )artiﬁcial viscosity, entering into the deﬁnition of pav(see Table 1).
__label__positive Figure 9shows the effect of these parameters on light curves for the Teff=6000 K Cepheid model.
__label__positive For Cq=4, the top panel shows that a different light curve develops only if αcut=0.0, corresponding to arti ﬁcial viscosity acting for very small compressions, which leads to excessive dissipation thatquenches the pulsation amplitude.
__label__positive For α cut0.01, the light curves are similar and roughly have the same pulsation amplitude.
__label__positive When αcut=0.1, arti ﬁcial viscosity turns on only for strong shocks, seen as the wiggle on the ascending branchof the light curve.
__label__positive This choice (α cut=0.1 )numerically captures shocks without excessive dissipation, barely affecting the light-curve shape and amplitude.
__label__positive While an arti ﬁcial viscosity modi ﬁes the velocity structure in the envelope at each epoch, we ﬁnd that these differences are smaller than the differences for the bolometric light curves.
__label__positive The bottom panelshows that the Tscharnuter & Winkler (1979 )form of arti ﬁcial viscosity yields light curves with the same amplitude and qualitatively the same shape.
__label__positive Small differences are apparent ata shock-prone phase shortly before the maximum brightness.
__label__positive Spatial and Temporal Sensitivity Figure 10shows the sensitivity of the bolometric light curve to the total number of cells N, number of cells above the anchor Nouter, anchor location Tanchor , and inner boundary locationTinner for an RR Lyrae model (M=0.65 Me,L=50Le, Teff=7000 K, X=0.75, Z=0.0014 )with convective para- meter set A.
__label__positive For classical pulsators, Tinneris typically placed at 2×106K, and common choices for Tanchor are 11,000 K or 15,000 K.
__label__positive The top panel shows that the light curves are weakly sensitive to the choice of TinnerandTanchor for this RR Lyrae model.
__label__positive Light and radial velocity curves are usually the most sensitive to NandNouter.
__label__positive The bottom panel shows that this effect is small for this RR Lyrae model.
__label__positive Section 2.4.4 shows a case with a much larger sensitivity.
__label__positive The default value of 600 time steps per pulsation cycle works well for most cases, but smaller time steps are recommended for models that include radiative cooling, turbulent pressure, or turbulent ﬂux, or develop violent pulsations (e.g., the chaotic models of Section 2.4.3 ).W e stress that there is no unique choice of grid or time step that will work for all applications or guarantees convergence.
__label__positive All nonlinear modeling of variable stars should be accompanied bysensitivity and convergence tests.
__label__positive Current Limitations and Plans for the Future RSP in its present form covers most of the classical instability strip, including δCepheids, RR Lyrae, high-amplitude δScuti, and SX Phoenicis stars (see Figure 1), where a single or just a few dominant radial modes are observed.
__label__positive RSP also has applications outside of the classical instability strip as we show below for BLAPs.
__label__positive For stars close to the main sequence (MS ), linear growth rates are very small, and thus, as we show below,Figure 7.

__label__positive long time integrations are necessary to approach full-amplitude nonlinear pulsations.
__label__positive RSP is currently of limited use for strongly nonadiabatic pulsations with large L/Mratios, including luminous blue variables, Mira-type variables, and type II Cepheids.
__label__positive For the latter, only the shortest-period BL Her class variables can be reliably modeled (see Section 2.4.3 ).
__label__positive For the longer-period classes of W Vir and RV Tau variables, either static envelopes cannot be constructed or nonlinear integra tions break down at when violent relaxations develop in the outermost layers.
__label__positive In the extended envelopes of these variable stars the radiation-diffusion approx- imation is inadequate owing to the low optical depth.
__label__positive Theinclusion of pulsation-driven mass loss may also be necessary to study pulsations of these variable stars (Smolec 2016 ).
__label__positive Inclusion of turbulent pressure and ﬂux may lead to convergence dif ﬁculties when constructing the static initial envelope.
__label__positive Cooler stellar envelopes with higher Mach number convection are also numerically more dif ﬁcult than hotter envelope models.
__label__positive These dif ﬁculties are rooted in the static grid structure shown in Figure 2.
__label__positive Future developments of RSP should include a more versatile initial model builder, adaptive remeshing during the time integration, and a radiationhydrodynamic treatment of the radiative energy and ﬂux.
__label__positive Applications of RSP We now apply RSP to variable stars.
__label__positive Examples include the light curves of classical pulsators, modeling of speci ﬁc objects, and models for the dynamics of modulated or chaotic pulsations.
__label__positive RR Lyrae Variables We consider two sequences of RR Lyrae-type models.
__label__positive The ﬁrst sequence has M=0.65Me,L=45Le,a n d [Fe/H]=−1.0 (X=0.75, Z=0.0014 ), with Teffvarying in 100 K steps for convective sets A –D.
__label__positive Figure 11shows a gallery of I-band light curves from this sequence.
__label__positive The top panel shows F-mode pulsators (commonly known as RRab stars ), and the bottom panel shows 1O-mode pulsators (known as RRc stars ).
__label__positive The latter have smaller amplitudes and are less nonlinear in shape (i.e., more sinusoidal ) than the F-mode light curves.
__label__positive M odels with different convective settings differ the most near minimum and maximum light.
__label__positive Forexample, F-mode models with convective set B develop a bump preceding minimum light that is absent in the light curves with convective set D.
__label__positive On the other hand, F-mode models with coolerT efffrom convective set D develop broad, double-peaked light- c u r v em a x i m at h a ta r ea b s e n ti n models from convective set B.
__label__positive To compare the overall morphology of I-band light curves from these sequences with OGLE observations, we perform a Fourier decomposition of the synthetic light curves () ( ) ( )å pf =+ +It A A k f t sin 2 , 6 kk k 0 where fis the pulsation frequency and Akandfkare amplitudes and phases, respectively.

__label__positive The observations show that the Fourier parameters follow progressions with pulsation period, traced by the highest density of data points, but withsigniﬁcant scatter.

__label__positive and D also progress similarly but are qualitatively different from those with convective sets A and B.
__label__positive These differences aremore pronounced for cooler, longer-period models.
__label__positive The overall match of the F-mode decompositions with the OGLE RRab stars (gray circles )is reasonable but shows some systematic differences.
__label__positive For example, the model values of j 31are larger than the observed values.
__label__positive However, the model physical parameters except Teffareﬁxed, while this is not the case for the OGLE RRab stars.
__label__positive The match between the 1O-mode models and the OGLE RRc stars (blue circles )is worse.
__label__positive The amplitudes and the amplitude ratios are systematically too large.
__label__positive This may indicate thatdifferent convective parameters are needed to reproduce the observed light-curve shapes of F-mode and 1O-mode pulsators.Note that the 1O-mode instability strip with convective set C is narrower than the F-mode instability strip at the luminosity considered.
__label__positive Models from set C, where the 1O-mode is linearlyunstable and the integration is initialized with a 1O-mode velocity perturbation, all switch to an F-mode pulsation.
__label__positive The right panels in Figure 12show that the light-curve shapes are sensitive to the physical parameters.
__label__positive By varying the luminosity and metallicity in a narrow range, the modelsequences match the OGLE values.
__label__positive However, no sequence considered follows the OGLE progression, because RR Lyrae in the Galactic bulge are characterized by mass, luminosity, andFigure 12.

__label__positive Classical F-mode Cepheids Cepheids display a feature known as the Hertzsprung progression (Hertzsprung 1926 ).
__label__positive A secondary bump in their light and radial velocity curves appears near minimum light on the descending branch when P;5 days.
__label__positive The bump moves toward earlier phases on the descending branch as the period increases and is coincident with maximum light when P;10 days.
__label__positive The bump then moves onto the ascending branch for longer periods and disappears at P;20 days.
__label__positive The bump is driven by a 2:1 resonance between the F-mode and a damped 2O-mode (e.g., Simon & Schmidt 1976; Buchler et al.
__label__positive This behavior is re ﬂected in Cepheids ’Fourier parameters, which follow more complex progressions with pulsation period than the RR Lyrae stars.
__label__positive We consider 4.5, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0 Memodels with X=0.736, Z=0.008, and convective parameter sets A – D.

__label__positive Blue and red edges of the instability strip computed with RSP for convective sets B and D are shown.
__label__positive Edges for convectivesets A and C largely overlap those for convective sets B and D,respectively.
__label__positive Nonlinear pulsation models are computed with a ΔT eff=300 K or 500 K offset from the blue edge.
__label__positive Figure 14shows I-band light curves and radial velocity curves for the ΔTeff=300 K models.
__label__positive Due to the shift in the location of blue edge models, models from convective sets B and D have different Teffand consequently different pulsation periods.
__label__positive Figure 15compares Fourier parameters of the Cepheid models with those derived from LMC Cepheid light curves (left panel; Ulaczyk et al.
__label__positive 2015 )and Galactic F-mode Cepheid radial velocity curves (right panel; Storm et al.
__label__positive The I-band light curves are more sensitive to the convective parameters than the radial velocity curves for bothΔT effoffsets.
__label__positive As with the RR Lyrae models, the Fourier parameters for convective sets A and B are similar to eachother, as are those for sets C and D.
__label__positive The radial velocity Fourier parameters follow tighter progressions than the I-band light curves.
__label__positive The Fourier phases in the left panels of Figure 15are systematically larger than the observationally inferred values forP10 days, with the difference being larger for the cooler ΔTeff=500 K models.
__label__positive For P10 days the model Fourier phases are systematically smaller.
__label__positive Large discrepancies for the radial velocity curves are absent in the right panels ofFigure 15, except for the amplitudes and R 21ratio at the shortest periods.
__label__positive The projection (orp)factor is the ratio of the pulsation velocity to the radial velocity deduced from spectral line-pro ﬁle observations, dependent on at least rotation and gravity darkening (see Section 4), and plays a role in theFigure 13.

__label__positive 12The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 243:10 (44pp ), 2019 July Paxton et al.
__label__positive We use p=1.3, close to the average value of determinations based on eclipsing binary Cepheid systems(Pilecki et al.
__label__positive 2018 )and interferometric methods (e.g., Breitfelder et al.
__label__positive This brief survey is not exhaustive, as only a few masses and two model sequences are explored.
__label__positive The M−Lrelation is also important for Cepheids, as evolutionary tracks depend on overshooting, rotation, and metallicity.
__label__positive Type II Cepheids Type II Cepheids are more similar to RR Lyrae stars than to classical Cepheids owing to their lower masses (M;0.5Me), Population II chemical composition, and evolutionary history.Their masses are similar to RR Lyrae, but they cross the instability strip at larger luminosities and pulsate with longerperiods (P>1 day ).
__label__positive Type II Cepheids are F-mode pulsators except for a few double-mode stars pulsating simultaneously inthe F- and 1O-modes (Smolec et al.
__label__positive 2018 ) and two recently discovered 1O-mode pulsators (Soszy ński et al.
__label__positive BL Her variables are a subclass of Type II Cepheids with P4 days.
__label__positive Nonlinear radiative models of Type II Cepheids revealed a variety of complex dynamics, including period-doubled anddeterministic chaos pulsations (e.g., Buchler & Kovacs 1987; Kovacs & Buchler 1988; Buchler & Moskalik 1992 ).

__label__positive 13The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 243:10 (44pp ), 2019 July Paxton et al.
__label__positive Buchler & Moskalik (1992 ) discovered period-doubled pulsations in their survey of BL Her models and predicted that they should be observed in BL Her variables.
__label__positive The period doubling is caused by a 3:2 resonance ofthe F- and 1O-modes and nonlinear phase synchronization(Moskalik & Buchler 1990 ); pulsations repeat only after two cycles of the F-mode.
__label__positive (2011 )report a period-doubled BL Her star, OGLE-BLG-T2CEP-279.
__label__positive We adopt M=0.6M e,L=184Le, Teff=6050 K, X=0.76, Z=0.01, and convective parameter set A.
__label__positive These are nearly the same physical parameters Smolecet al.
__label__positive The observed and model light curves are shown in Figure 16.
__label__positive The model amplitudes of the bump at minimum light of the period-doubled cycle are larger and the shape of the light maximum is more pronounced relative to the observed features.
__label__positive The model period, P model =2.6976 days, is longer than the observed period, Pobs=2.3993 days.
__label__positive Still, the light curves are qualita- tively similar, devoid of ﬁne-tuning, and demonstrate that RSP can be used to model speci ﬁc stars.
__label__positive Figure 17shows the radius variation for two models with M=0.55 Me,L=136Le,X=0.76, Z=0.0001, and con- vective set A but with a reduced eddy viscosity, αm=0.05(yielding unrealistic light curves ).
__label__positive The two models differ only inTeff=5932 K (top panel )andTeff=6410 K (bottom panel ).
__label__positive Figure 18shows the return map of maximum radii for these two models, plotting the maximum radii for each pulsation cycle Rn maxversus the preceding-Rn max1.
__label__positive For the cooler Teff=5932 K model, the top panel of Figure 17shows a cyclic modulation in the envelope of the period-doubled pulsation.
__label__positive The modulation period of ;57 days is longer than the pulsation period of ;2.3 days.
__label__positive The return map in the top panel of Figure 18is constructed from ;8000 pulsation cycles and shows two loops, corresponding toalternating smaller and larger maximum radii.
__label__positive Since themodulation period is not commensurate with the pulsationperiod, the return maps develop a locus of points that form theclosed lobes.
__label__positive Light-curve modulation is common in RR Lyrae stars (Blazhko effect ), and periodic pulsation modulation was recently discovered in BL Her variables (Smolec et al.
__label__positive Comparison of the observed I-band light curve of OGLE-BLG- T2CEP-279 (blue circles )with the pulsation model (red curve ).
__label__positive The period- doubling effect is recognizable upon comparing consecutive maxima and minima.
__label__positive Radius variation in two models differing only in their Teffthat show periodic modulation (top panel )and deterministic chaos (bottom panel ).
__label__positive Maximum radius return maps for the models in Figure 17.
__label__positive 14The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 243:10 (44pp ), 2019 July Paxton et al.
__label__positive For the hotter Teff=6410 K model, the radius variation appears irregular in the bottom panel of Figure 17.
__label__positive The return map in the bottom panel of Figure 18reveals a strange attractor, an example of deterministic chaos in nonlinear models.
__label__positive Tracing time series from models is simple, but tracing chaotic dynamics inobservations is dif ﬁcult (e.g., Plachy et al.
__label__positive Chaotic dynamics is reported in a few t ype II Cepheids with longer periods, in the RV Tau variable star range, and in semiregular variable stars (e.g., Buchler et al.
__label__positive While the T eff=6410 K model has a shorter period, in the BL Her range, such models may provide insight into chaotic dynamics in pulsating stars (see Plachy et al.
__label__positive Binary Evolution Pulsators Very low mass stars do not enter the classical instability strip within a Hubble time.
__label__positive However, mass loss from the more massive component in a close interacting binary can lead to a low-mass star that then evolves through the instability strip.The Binary Evolution Pulsator (BEP, OGLE-BLG-RRLYR- 02792 )is the prototype of this new class of pulsators (Pietrzynski et al.
__label__positive The BEP ʼs variability is similar to an F-mode RR Lyrae pulsator but with a dynamical mass of ;0.26 M e.
__label__positive (2013 ), we adopt M=0.26 Me, L=33Le,Teff=6910 K, X=0.7,Z=0.01, and convective set A.
__label__positive Figure 19shows I-band light curves and radial velocitycurves for the BEP models.
__label__positive Results for a coarse grid (N/Nouter =150/40, gold curves )qualitatively match these observations and have a period of 0.6373 days close to theobserved 0.6275-day period.
__label__positive We also show results for amedium grid (300/120, orange curves )and a ﬁne grid (300/ 120, red curves ).
__label__positive The differences are most pronounced around maximum and minimum light.
__label__positive The shape of the light and radial velocity curves approach convergence only on grids with 600 cells.
__label__positive The amplitude of the model curves is sensitive toconvective parameters and can be ﬁne-tuned for a better match with observations.
__label__positive Blue Large-amplitude Pulsators The origin of BLAPs, introduced in Section 1, is unknown.
__label__positive They have been modeled as ;0.3Meshell H-burning stars that are progenitors of low-mass WDs and ;1.0Mestars under- going core He burning (Pietrukowicz et al.
__label__positive Though mass loss in a close interacting binary must be invoked for bothhypotheses, none of the BLAPs are known to be in a binary.Figure 1shows that BLAPs are located near sdBVs in the H-R diagram.
__label__positive The latter have noncanonical abundance pro ﬁles that are strongly affected by radiative levitation (see Section 6.2 ).
__label__positive (2018 ), we adopt Z=0.05, to account for the increased envelope metallicity caused by radiative levitation.Figure 19.

__label__positive Pulsation periods of the models range between 34.27 and 34.34 minutes, and the observed period is 34.87 minutes.
__label__positive 15The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 243:10 (44pp ), 2019 July Paxton et al.
__label__positive We explored nonlinear models with M=1.0Me,Teff= 30,000 K, L=430Le, and three convection parameter sets.
__label__positive These envelope models used N=280, Nouter =140, Tanchor = 2×105K, and Tinner =6×106K.
__label__positive The LNA analyses show that the F- and 1O-modes are unstable.
__label__positive Figure 20compares the OGLE-BLAP-011 and 1O-mode (P;35 minutes )model I-band light curves.
__label__positive Figure 20 shows that the model radial vel ocity curves have amplitudes of ;200 km s−1, a pronounced temporal asymmetry, and light maxima that are narrower than light minima.
__label__positive These BLAP models lie far off the classical instability strip so that the initial model builder (see Section 2.2.1 ), which is optimized for classical pulsators, failed to relax the initial models to complete hydrostatic equilibrium.
__label__positive An option is to switch off the relaxation process and commence the time integration with a near-hydrostatic-equilibrium initial model.
__label__positive The price to pay is that the LNA growth rates are onlyindicative, not accurate.
__label__positive Figure 21shows the evolution of Γfor the (α,α m)=(1.5, 0.1 )model in Figure 20.
__label__positive Before ;10 days, Γﬂuctuates around a mean of ;7.5 ×10−3.
__label__positive The ﬂuctuations diminish with time, butΓremains above the LNA value of 6.25 ×10−3up to ;30 days.
__label__positive Between 30 and 50 days Γdiminishes and approaches zero, the sign that the nonlinear pulsation saturates at its terminal amplitude, yielding the results of Figure 20.I n contrast to Γ, the period of the nonlinear pulsations remains close to the LNA period.
__label__positive In cases where the initial model cannot be relaxed, the initial Γshould not be expected to match the LNA analysis.
__label__positive High-amplitude Delta Scuti High-amplitude δScuti (HADS )pulsators are de ﬁned to have V-band light-curve amplitudes greater than 0.1 mag.
__label__positive HADS pulsators lie close to the MS (see Figure 1), where growth rates are usually much smaller than those for RR Lyrae stars or classical Cepheids.
__label__positive This implies that long timeintegrations are needed to drive nonlinear pulsations to saturation.We consider a stellar model with M=2M e,L=30Le, Teff=6900 K, X=0.7,Z=0.01, and convective set A.
__label__positive This represents a star evolving toward the Hertzsprung gap.
__label__positive The LNA analysis of the initial model reveals that the F- and 1O- modes are linearly unstable, with growth rates of 1 ×10−6and 6×10−5, respectively.
__label__positive Section 3emphasizes the importance of numerical energy conservation.
__label__positive Figure 22shows the evolution of the relative cumulative error in the energy for a 250,000-cycle integration(;150 million time steps, at 600 steps per cycle ).
__label__positive The relative cumulative error grows from ;3×10 −11after about 15 cycles to;3×10−7after 250,000 cycles.
__label__positive The inset ﬁgure shows that the per-step relative error in the energy scatters around−2.5 ×10 −15but is systematically different than zero.
__label__positive Figure 23shows that after 70,000 cycles the asymmetric V-band light curves have an amplitude of ;0.2 mag.
__label__positive Evolution of the RSP growth rate Γstarting from the unrelaxed initial model for convection set b in Figure 20.

__label__positive Evolution of the relative cumulative energy error from model 10,000 (;15 cycles )to;150 million (at;250,000 cycles ).
__label__positive The inset shows the per-step relative energy error over a cycle (600 steps ).
__label__positive V-band light curves of the δSct model at three stages during a very long (;150 million time steps )integration.
__label__positive For each stage, we plot the light curve for 5 pulsation cycles.
__label__positive The legend gives the cycle numbers when the snapshots were taken.
__label__positive 16The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 243:10 (44pp ), 2019 July Paxton et al.
__label__positive dominant pulsation period is 0.127 days, close to the LNA period of 0.1269 days for the 1O-mode.
__label__positive The amplitude, though, variescyclically over about four pulsation cycles, re ﬂecting the presence of the F-mode.
__label__positive Continuing the integration to 130,000 cycles leads to a more saturated light curve with an amplitude of ;0.3 mag and an unchanged dominant pulsation p eriod.
__label__positive Extending the integra- tion to 250,000 cycles does not lead to any signi ﬁcant changes.
__label__positive The robustness in the light curves between 130,000 and 250,000 cycles might suggest that the long-term behavior isthat of a double-mode HADS model.
__label__positive However, additional integrations with different initial perturbations, chosen to more adequately sample the neighboring amplitude phase space, arenecessary to assess the possible mode selection.
__label__positive Figure 24 shows the evolution of these integrations in the amplitude – amplitude diagram using the analytical signal method (e.g., Kolláth et al.
__label__positive The amplitude behavior of the model integration shown in Figure 23is traced out by the red line.
__label__positive After initially rapid evolution, all the amplitude trajectoriesdevelop an arc along which evolution slows markedly.
__label__positive Themodel in Figure 23and neighboring trajectories bend to the left toward smaller F-mode amplitudes.
__label__positive Their likely ﬁnal state is that of a single-periodic 1O pulsation.
__label__positive In contrast, the tworightmost trajectories bend to the right toward larger, more dominant F-mode amplitudes.
__label__positive Despite the limited sampling of phase space in Figure 24, we cautiously conclude that the most likely long-term outcome of this δSct model is a single- periodic 1O-mode or F-mode pulsator depending on the initial conditions (see Section 2.2.4 ).
__label__positive Energy Conservation For the following discussion we de ﬁne the total energy Eof a model to be the sum of the internal, potential, and kinetic energies, ignoring rotational energy and turbulent energy, which arecurrently not included in the energy accounting.
__label__positive To support improved numerical energy conservation, 19MESAstar provides an option to use what we call the dedt -form of the energy equation: ⎜⎟⎛ ⎝⎞ ⎠() ( ) =-¶ ¶+- -  De Dt mLp uD DtuGm r1 2.82 This form was introduced in Paper IVand provides an alternative to the dLdm -form of the energy equation (Equation (11)in Paper I).
__label__positive When the time derivative terms are combined, the result is more easily recognizable as an equation for the time evolution of local speci ﬁc total energy (left-hand side )due to local source terms20(ò)and local ﬂuxes between cells (the ∂/∂mterm ): ⎜⎟⎛ ⎝⎞ ⎠() ( ) +- = -¶ ¶+  D DteuGm rmLp u1 2.92 The error in numerical energy conservation Eerroris the extent to which the time- and mass-integrated Equation (9)is notsatisﬁed when solved in a discretized, ﬁnite-mass form.
__label__positive This section discusses recent efforts to improve numerical energy conservation in MESAstar .
__label__positive Recall (from Paper I, Section 6.3 )the generalized Newton – Raphson scheme used by MESAstar to solve the stellar equations ⎡ ⎣⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ () ( ) ( ) ( ) ()dd d ==+ =+ +Fy Fy y FyF yyyd dO 0, 10ii i ii i2 where yiis the trial solution for the ith iteration, ()Fyiis the residual, dyiis the correction, and [ ]Fydd iis the Jacobian matrix.
__label__positive The residual is the leftover difference between the left-and right-hand sides of the equation we are trying to solve,while the correction is the change in the primary variable that is calculated by Newton ʼs rule.
__label__positive The solver generates a series of trial solutions until it produces one that is acceptable accordingto given convergence criteria.
__label__positive In MESAstar the trial solution is not accepted until the magnitudes of all corrections andresiduals become smaller than speci ﬁed tolerances.
__label__positive 21If no acceptable trial solution has been found in the allowedmaximum number of iterations, the solver rejects the attemptand forces a retry with a smaller time step.
__label__positive If the numerical accuracy of the partial derivatives forming the Jacobian matrix is not excellent, the reduction in magnitudeof the residuals can stall after a few iterations.
__label__positive For this reason, MESAstar has provided a means to use a tight tolerance on residuals for an initial sequence of iterations and then switch toa much relaxed tolerance if no acceptable solution has been found.
__label__positive The bene ﬁt of this is that residuals will be driven downFigure 24.
__label__positive Evolution of fractional radius amplitude, δR/R, for the 1O-mode, A1, and F-mode, A0.
__label__positive Eight trajectories begin at locations marked with a cross.
__label__positive Circles mark 1000-day intervals along trajectories.
__label__positive The red curve correspondsto the model in Figure 23, with the three open circles marking the amplitudes after 70,000, 130,000, and 250,000 cycles.
__label__positive The inset on the upper right zooms into the slowing amplitude evolution of the red curve late in the simulation.
__label__positive 19Note that we are discussing numerical issues in the code rather than questions of the physical completeness and validity of the equations.
__label__positive We will often use the term “numerical energy conservation ”to make this distinction explicit.
__label__positive 20This includes energy from nuclear reactions (ònuc)and thermal neutrino losses (−òν), as well as terms associated with other processes such as accretion (see Section 3.3 ).
__label__positive Importantly, òdoes not include ògrav, the speci ﬁc rate of change of gravothermal energy, as that source term is not present when using a total form of the energy equation (see Paper IV, Section 8 ).21GARching STellar Evolution Code (GARSTEC )and MONSTAR are the only other stellar evolution software instruments we are aware of that consider residuals as well as corrections in deciding when to accept a trial solution(Weiss & Schlattl 2008; J.
__label__positive Several other codes consider corrections but not, as far as we can tell, residuals (Faulkner 1968; Christensen-Dalsgaard 2008; Demarque et al.
__label__positive 17The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 243:10 (44pp ), 2019 July Paxton et al.
__label__positive when possible, but if the residuals stall at a level above the initial tolerance, the system will still be able to take a step as long as the corrections can be adequately reduced.
__label__positive The cost ofrelaxing the tolerance for residuals of the total energy equation is the creation of numerical energy conservation errors.
__label__positive To obtain good numerical energy conservation we must be able todrive down residuals to low levels, and to do that we must havenumerically accurate partial derivatives.
__label__positive This has motivated a major effort to improve partials, and we can now require the solver to keep iterating until it reduces the residuals to a lowlevel that gives good numerical energy conservation.
__label__positive The most signiﬁcant changes to improve the numerical accuracy of partials were in the eos module and are discussed in Appendix A.1.
__label__positive Gold Tolerances To improve energy conservation, a new standard “gold tolerances ”is now the default in MESAstar .
__label__positive This uses tight tolerances that apply even after an arbitrarily large number ofiterations.
__label__positive As a result, steps with poor residuals will be rejected,thereby ensuring that if a run succeeds with gold tolerancesenabled while using the total energy equation given above, it will have good energy conservation.
__label__positive To show exampleimprovements from this new strategy, in Table 5we report the results of calculations of a 1 M emodel during the MS and the He ﬂash with gold tolerances and compare to the old approach.
__label__positive The 1 Memodels are evolved from the ZAMS until the core H mass fraction reaches a value of 10−6.
__label__positive The He ﬂash models start at off-center He ignition and terminate when thecore He mass fraction drops to 10 −3.
__label__positive The cumulative energy error is the sum of the energy conservation errors at each of thesteps.
__label__positive The relative cumulative energy error is the cumulativeenergy error divided by the ﬁnal total energy.
__label__positive This is now much less than 1% during the He ﬂash, a notoriously dif ﬁcultTable 5 Relative Cumulative Energy Error for 1 MeRuns Main Sequence He Flash dedt +gold tolerances 0.3% 0.0006% dLdm 14% 12% Figure 25.

__label__positive The ﬁrst panel shows a Kippenhahn plot, where green hatched regions are convective and blue shading shows region of nuclear energy generation.
__label__positive The second panel shows the absolute error in energy conservation divided by th e total stellar energy, both per step and cumulative.
__label__positive The third panel shows the time step, while in the fourth panel we report the number of iterations required by the Ne wton– Raphson solver.
__label__positive Gold tolerances keep the cumulative errors small during the He ﬂash at the price of a larger number of iterations during the ﬁrst≈200 time steps.
__label__positive 18The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 243:10 (44pp ), 2019 July Paxton et al.
__label__positive evolutionary phase from the numerical perspective.
__label__positive The evolution of the errors in energy conservation, as well as thenumber of iterations required by the solver and the adopted time step, are shown in Figure 25for the He ﬂash runs.
__label__positive This ﬁgure clearly shows the superiority of the model adopting gold tolerances and the dedt -form of the equation in terms of energy conservation.
__label__positive Not all cases in the MESAstar test suite are currently able to use gold tolerances.
__label__positive This is primarily because of remainingproblems with the numerical accuracy of certain partials, especially in the PC EOS (Potekhin & Chabrier 2010 )that is used by WD models (see Appendix A.1 )and on the boundary between the OPAL EOS (Rogers & Nayfonov 2002 )and the SCVH EOS (Saumon et al.
__label__positive There are also problems with the numerical accuracy of some partials associated withnuclear reactions at the high temperatures encountered during late stages of evolution, such as Si burning.
__label__positive To address these situations, there are controls to allow gold tolerances to beturned off automatically for steps that either require use of thePC EOS or have extremely high temperatures.
__label__positive To provide feedback, the value of the relative cumulative energy error is monitored, and a warning message is written if it exceeds aspeciﬁed value (2% is the default setting ).
__label__positive De ﬁnition of ò nucSource Term Previous MESA papers have not given a precise de ﬁnition of ònuc.
__label__positive Motivated by numerical convenience, MESA formerly exploited the fact that the òsource term contained the sum of ògravand ònucand included the response of the internal energy to composition changes due to nuclear reactions in ònucinstead of in ògrav.
__label__positive However, since the dedt -form does not include ògrav, this is no longer an appropriate choice.
__label__positive In the current approach, ònucis evaluated in the net module as a sum over reactions.
__label__positive Schematically, () ( )å=- n  NQ Q R ,1 1 ii i nuc A reactions, where Riis the molar rate of reaction i,Qiis the change in rest- mass energy between the products and reactants, and Qν,iis the per-reaction average energy of the neutrino (if present ).W e note the equivalence ˙ () åå º- QR McY ,1 2 ii i i reactions isotopes2 where Miis the rest mass of isotope iand˙Yiis the rate of change of the molar fraction.
__label__positive The approx family of MESA nuclear networks exploits this equivalence and does not strictly followEquation (11).
__label__positive The right-hand side of Equation (12)is a common nuclear physics de ﬁnition of ò nuc (e.g., Equation (11) in Hix & Meyer 2006 ).
__label__positive The MESA deﬁnition of ònucdiffers in subtracting off the nuclear neutrino losses, thus enforcing theassumption that they free-stream out of the star.
__label__positive Mass Changes The methods described above perform well for numerical energy conservation when the stellar mass is constant, butextensions are necessary for cases where the mass changes.
__label__positive For energy accounting, we must specify the amount of energy we expect the new mass to introduce and the amount we expectdeparting mass to remove.
__label__positive To that end we assume that massbeing added has the same speci ﬁc energy as the surface of themodel at the start of the step.
__label__positive For mass being removed, we assume that it leaves with a speci ﬁc energy between what it had at the start of the step and the value at the surface at the start of the step.
__label__positive The exact amount depends on the amount of energy that leaks out of the material as it approaches the surface duringthe time step.
__label__positive For low rates of mass loss there will be adequatetime for the material to adjust so that it leaves with the initial surface value, but for high rates there may not be enough time for adjustment, so that it leaves with a speci ﬁc energy closer to its starting value.
__label__positive In addition to providing accurate accounting for the total energy of the model, it is important to ensure that the energychanges from mass loss or gain are distributed properly within the model.
__label__positive As a guide for this we use the analytic calculations of Townsley & Bildsten (2004 ).
__label__positive Our new procedure improves on these by also calculating the distribution of energy in systems with long thermal times, allowing MESA to handle the limit of rapid accretion.
__label__positive We con ﬁrm the numerical energy conservation of this method using the >20 cases in the MESAstar test suite that have mass changes and fully support gold tolerances and the dedt -form of the energy equation.
__label__positive Using the new scheme, each of these completes the test runwith a cumulative error in total energy <2%.
__label__positive In addition, test cases that depend on the internal distribution of accretion heating continue to yield the expected results.
__label__positive Methodology Because MESA works on a Lagrangian mesh, it handles accretion and mass loss in a two-stage process (Paper III, Section 7 ).
__label__positive In stage I the masses of certain cells are increased or decreased as needed to give the desired end-of-step total mass,but no attempt is made to ensure energy conservation at this stage.
__label__positive In stage II the model thus produced is evolved in time by an amount dt.
__label__positive This separation of stages means that the time step is only taken for a model of ﬁxed mass.
__label__positive However, because the energy of the model changes in stage I, a correction must be added to stage II to make the overall step consistent withenergy conservation.
__label__positive Thus, we introduce a new source term ˙M that accounts for the heating associated with mass changes.
__label__positive The change in the mass of cell kduring stage I results from the difference between the outward22mass ﬂuxFmthrough each cell face.
__label__positive This ﬂux obeys () ( )d -= - + dm dm t F F 13 k k mk mk mid, start, , 1 , and ˙ () dd -= -= M M tF tM .1 4 m mid start ,1 During stage I the temperature, density, and velocity of each cell are held ﬁxed, but the composition is updated to track the ﬂow of material between cells.
__label__positive The subscript start is used for quantities at the start of stage I.
__label__positive The subscript mid is used for quantities at end of stage I, which is the start of stage II.
__label__positive No subscript is used for quantities evaluated at the end of the timestep (after stage II).
__label__positive There is no mass change during stage II, so dm k=dmmid,k.
__label__positive 22Fork>1, this ﬂux is from cell kto cell k−1; for k=1 this ﬂux is out of the model.

__label__positive We now introduce òk,I, the effective source term in cell k during stage I.
__label__positive This is de ﬁned by writing the change in energy inﬂux-conservative form as () ( )d -= + - +  EE t d mF F ,1 7 k k k k ek ek mid, start, ,I , 1,I , ,I where Fe,k,Iis the outward ﬂux of energy across face kowing to work and material passing through face k.

__label__positive The additional ò k,Iterm implies the need for a corrective source term ˙Mthat must be added during stage II so that energy is properly accounted for.
__label__positive To determine this new source, we consider the ratio of the thermal timescale, ()() tº-  xc T L,2 2 km kth,p rad ad start,to the mass-change timescale () tºx F,2 3 km m km, start, where xm,kis the mass above face k.
__label__positive When this ratio is small, the thermodynamic state of material is a function primarily ofdepth (Sugimoto 1970; Sugimoto & Nomoto 1975 ).
__label__positive This means that as material moves from cell to cell it is a goodapproximation to the time evolution to suppose that it adoptsthe state of whichever cell it is in (Paper III).
__label__positive In the opposing limit (τ th?τm)the entropy of material adjusts minimally as it moves from cell to cell.
__label__positive We account for the effects of the thermal and mass-change timescales by tracking the heating of material as it moves fromcell to cell in stage I and estimating what fraction of that heat is released as part of Lversus carried by the material.
__label__positive Consider the path taken by an in ﬁnitesimal ﬂuid element as it moves from face kto face k+1 due to accretion.
__label__positive Over the course of this adjustment the material changes state and releases some heat.
__label__positive We take this heat to be given by () d=- dq tdm dm,2 4k kk k,I pass, where (( ) ( ) ) ()d =+ - + dm dm t F F max 0, min 0, 25k k mk mk pass, start, , 1 , is the total mass of material that at any point during stage I was inside cell k.
__label__positive This evenly distributes the heating that occurs in a cell over all material that starts in, ends in, or passes throughthe cell.
__label__positive When the thermal time is long, however, the ﬂuid does not have a chance to release all of this heat before it hasﬁnished crossing the cell.
__label__positive We estimate the fraction of this heat it releases as the leak fraction ⎛ ⎝⎜⎞ ⎠⎟ ()t tº f min 1, .
__label__positive 26kk kleak,m, th, This parameterizes the extent to which material ﬂowing through a cell follows the implied energy gradient (fleak, k≈1)versus evolving adiabatically (fleak, k=1).
__label__positive We de ﬁneδEk,jto be the amount of energy that the material that ends up in cell jhad not leaked by the time it reached face k.

__label__positive The same procedure may be used in the case of mass loss, but with δEN+1,j=0 instead of δE1,jand−1 in the subscript on the left-hand side of Equation (27)rather than +1.
__label__positive In the limit of long thermal times most heat is retained and the resulting evolution is adiabatic.

__label__positive the limit of short thermal times we recover the results of Paper III.
__label__positive Along the lines of Equation (17), the energy change of cell k during stage II may now be written in ﬂux-conservative form as [( ) ] ( ) ˙ d -= + + - +  EE t d m F F ,2 9 kk k M k e k e k mid, , , 1,II , ,II where ˆ () =+  FL p v 30 ek k kkk ,, I I face, ,II and ˆ ()dº-vrr t.3 1 kkk ,IImid, MESA solves Equation (29)when using the dedt -form with mass changes.
__label__positive Because the time evolution is implicit, allsources are evaluated at the end of stage II.
__label__positive Nuclear burning is evaluated as if material spends the whole step in the cell in which it ends stage I.
__label__positive While this is usually a goodapproximation, it may break down when ˙dtMis large relative to the masses of cells in burning regions.

__label__positive This term is explicitly accounted for in the MESA energy budget, so in both cases energy is properlyaccounted for.
__label__positive Results To examine the behavior of ˙M, we modeled a 0.33 MeWD accreting He and N at a rate of 10−5Meyr−1.
__label__positive The ﬁrst panel of Figure 26shows a pro ﬁle of ˙Malong with the analytic accretion heating calculations of Townsley & Bildsten (2004 ).
__label__positive The second panelshows the mass integral of the same inward from the surface, while the third shows their ratio.
__label__positive Around x m≈1026g,τth becomes long relative to τm, and the two prescriptions differ because that of Townsley & Bildsten (2004 )is only applicable where τth=τm.
__label__positive To demonstrate improved energy conservation during mass changes with the dedt -form, we model accretion onto a 0.3MeHe WD with an initial ()= Tlog K 6.7 c .
__label__positive Nuclear reactions are disabled throughout the run.
__label__positive The relative cumulative error in energy conservation is shown in the top panel of Figure 27, and the relative error in each step is shown in the bottom panel.
__label__positive Near the beginning of the run thereis a period where the dLdm -form performs better; however, at those early times both forms do a good job, conserving energy to 1 part in ∼105.
__label__positive At later times the dedt -form produces less error, staying below 1 part in 104, while the dLdm -form yields cumulative errors greater than 1 part in 103.We prefer using the dedt -form because of its improved energy conservation and handling of long thermal times.
__label__positive We now explore the consequences for stellar evolution of thesedifferent prescriptions.
__label__positive The top panel of Figure 28shows the luminosity for the same case as Figure 27, again for both the dedt -form and the dLdm -form.
__label__positive The largest differences are at early times as the models adjust to the accretion.
__label__positive After that, both yield results similar to a few percent, and the relative difference onlyimproves as the luminosity increases.
__label__positive Figure 29shows Tcfor the same two runs as a function of time.
__label__positive This is because the core lies beneath the region wherecell masses are adjusted signi ﬁcantly, so the precise handling of mass changes only matters for the core insofar as the core temperature is sensitive to the luminosity.
__label__positive Mass changes are ubiquitous in binary stellar evolution.
__label__positive To demonstrate the effect of the dedt -form, we model theFigure 26.

__label__positive Rotation For a rigidly rotating star in hydrostatic equilibrium, surfaces of constant pressure (isobars )coincide with the equipotential surfaces de ﬁned by the Roche potential Ψ, () () ( )qqqY= F-Wrrr,,sin 2,3 422 2 where Φis the standard Newtonian potential, θis the polar angle, and Ωis the angular frequency of rotation.
__label__positive In one- dimensional stellar evolution calculations the effects of rotationon the stellar structure are usually captured by a simplemodiﬁcation of the stellar equations.
__label__positive These retain their regular form but include two correction factors, ⎛ ⎝⎜⎞ ⎠⎟ ()pp=áñ=áñ á ñY YY-Y Y-fr Gm S gfr Sg g4 1,4 1,3 5PT4 122 1 where rΨis the volume-equivalent radius of an isobar and mΨ andSΨare the mass inside that isobar and its surface area, respectively (Kippenhahn & Thomas 1970; Endal & So ﬁa 1976 ).
__label__positive The effective gravity is ∣∣= Yg , whileáñgandáñ-g1 are surface averages over the equipotential.24 This approach is still applicable to the case of a differentially rotating star under the assumption of shellular rotation, inwhich shells are rigidly rotating, isobaric surfaces with rotation frequency Ω Ψ(Endal & So ﬁa1976; Zahn 1992 ).
__label__positive The averages in Equation (35)are performed over each isobar (Meynet & Maeder 1997 ).Until now, MESA used the method of Endal & So ﬁa(1976 ), which considers deviations of the Roche potential from spherical symmetry (Kopal 1959 ), to compute the fPandfT factors.
__label__positive One issue is that to ensure numerical stability, this approach requires a ﬂoor on the correction factors (fP=0.75 andfT=0.95; Paper II), corresponding to a maximum rotation rate of 60% of critical rotation (the angular frequency at which the centrifugal force would match gravity at the stellar equator ).
__label__positive As stars are centrally condensed and rotational frequencies close to critical are typically reached only in the outermost layers, Ψis well approximated by the pot ential of a point mass in rapidly rotating layers (e.g., Maeder 2009 ).T h i sj u s t i ﬁes using the Newtonian potential as Φ=−GmΨ/rfor the calculation of fPand fT, such that they are only functions of the fraction of critical rotation /wºW W =WYY Y Y Gm r crit, e3.H e r e reis the equatorial radius of the isobar and Ωcrit,Ψis the rotational frequency at which the centrifugal force is equal to gravity at theequator of the isobar.

__label__positive Both are similar to the corresponding curves in Figure 4o fP a p e r III.

__label__positive 24In Paper IIwe de ﬁned the volume-equivalent radius as rP, while here we adopt the symbol rΨas used by Endal & So ﬁa(1976 ).
__label__positive This change is to prevent confusion between rΨand the polar radius of an isobar, which we denote as rp.

__label__positive as a function of ω, () w =+r r11 2.3 8e p2 Figure 32shows how the equipotential surfaces change with increasing ω.
__label__positive For ω0.5 the equipotentials are approximately given by oblate spheroids, while for ωclose to unity a cusp develops at the equator.
__label__positive For this critically rotating surface, the polar radius is two-thirds of the equatorial one.
__label__positive By determining the asymptotic behavior of the Roche potential in the limit w0, and, when possible, also in the limitw1, we have constructed analytic ﬁts to properties of interest.
__label__positive These are described in Appendix Band include ﬁts for the equatorial radius re(rΨ,ω), the centrifugal corrections fP(ω) and fT(ω), and the volumes and surface areas of Roche equipotentials, VΨ(re,ω)andSΨ(re,ω).
__label__positive Previous versions of MESA approximated the speci ﬁc moment of inertia of isobaric surfaces as that of a thin spherical shell with radius rΨ, =Y ir 2 3 rot2, but now default to a ﬁt of the form irot(re,ω).
__label__positive Figure 33shows the resulting ﬁts for irot,fP, and fT.
__label__positive The new implementation results in values of the speci ﬁc moment of inertia that are larger by a factor of two as w1.
__label__positive Implementation in Stellar Evolution Instruments To include these ﬁts in a stellar evolution calculation that uses the shellular approximation, a value of ωmust be determined for a given speci ﬁc angular momentum jrot,mΨ, and rΨ.

__label__positive We compute the solution to this equation for each cell in the stellar model using a bisection method.
__label__positive Given ω, we then use the computed ﬁts to determine the values required by the structure equations: r e,rp,irot,ΩΨ,fP, and fT.A s in the previous implementation of rotation in MESA ,w e evaluate these quantities explicitly at the beginning and atthe end of a step.
__label__positive The analytical nature of the ﬁts allows the possibility of a fully coupled and implicit implementation in thefuture.
__label__positive Figure 34shows a 3 M esolar-metallicity model with different initial rotational velocities, evolved using the currentand previous implementations of rotation in MESA .
__label__positive Differences at higher rotation rates are due to the aforementioned ﬂoor on f PandfT.
__label__positive In our current approach we also de ﬁne a ﬂoor on fPandfTin terms of a maximum value ωmax, beyond which the effects are truncated to fP(ωmax )andfT(ωmax ).W e ﬁnd that calculations using the new strategy are numerically stable near critical rotation, with the simulations shown in Figure 34being performed with ωmax =0.9.
__label__positive This is in comparison to the previous method, which for rapidly rotating models set a ﬂoor onfPand fTcorresponding to their values at ω≈0.6.
__label__positive Therefore, MESA can now consistently calculate shellular rotation models closer to critical rotation.
__label__positive Gravity-darkening Corrections Rotating stars are subject to gravity darkening (von Zeipel 1924a ,1924b ).
__label__positive The variation of ﬂux over the surface and the distorted stellar shape imply that the observedproperties of the star vary with the angle between the rotation axis of the star and the line of sight (LOS ).
__label__positive Here we describe our approach to calculating geometric factors that allow theintrinsic surface quantities Land T effto be corrected for projection effects along a given LOS.

__label__positive Convective Boundaries and Semiconvection Regions The correct treatment of convective boundaries continues to be a challenging problem.
__label__positive In this section, we discuss three approaches: the “sign-change ”algorithm (Papers I,II),a n improved approach called “predictive mixing ”(Paper IV), and a new “convective premixing (CPM )”scheme that addresses several remaining issues.
__label__positive Early versions of MESA located convective boundaries by searching for sign changes in the discriminant y,d eﬁned by y=yS≡∇rad−∇adwhen the Schwarzschild criterion is used to assess convective stability, or by y=yL≡∇rad−∇Lwhen the Ledoux criterion is used; here ∇rad,∇ad, and∇Lare the Figure 35.

__label__positive radiative, adiabatic, and Ledoux temperature gradients, respec- tively.
__label__positive As demonstrated in Paper IV, this sign-change algo- rithm can fail at convective boundaries that exhibit compositiondiscontinuities.
__label__positive Typically, the failing cases exhibit ∇ rad appreciably larger than ∇adon the convective side of the boundary.
__label__positive (2014 ), physical consistency within local MLT dictates that ∇rad=∇adshould hold on the convective side.
__label__positive In Paper IVwe introduced the predictive mixing scheme for treatment of convective boundaries.
__label__positive This scheme improves onthe sign-change algorithm by allowing each convection region to expand during a time step until its boundaries satisfy ∇ rad=∇adon their convective side.
__label__positive The expansion is achieved by modifying convective diffusivities in the cells on the radiative side of a boundary.
__label__positive In Paper IV, we applied predictive mixing in ﬁve scenarios: a growing convective core in a 1.5 Mestar on the MS, a retreating convective core in a 16Mestar on the MS, growing convective cores in 1 and 3 Me stars during the core helium-burning (CHeB )phase, and an evolving convective envelope in a 1 Mestar on the MS.
__label__positive Predictive mixing is able to achieve the desired ∇rad=∇ad outcome in most of these cases.
__label__positive However, two cases shown in Paper IVcontinue to exhibit ∇rad>∇adon the convective side of a boundary of a convection region, highlighting the need for further work and motivating us to develop a new scheme for treating convectiveboundaries.
__label__positive This CPM scheme, draws inspiration from earlier work by Castellani et al.
__label__positive In the following, we ﬁrst discuss why predictive mixing sometimes fails.
__label__positive Then, we describe the new CPM scheme in detail (Section 5.2 )and demonstrate its application in various evolutionary scenarios (Sections 5.3–5.5 ).
__label__positive The Failure of Predictive Mixing The 16 M eMS scenario presented in Figure 4 of Paper IV exhibits a convective shell above the abundance gradient regionwith∇rad>∇adat its lower boundary.
__label__positive If predictive mixing is applied to the shell, the lower boundary advances downward to merge with the core, while the upper boundary remains ﬁxed in position.
__label__positive The end result is that the entire abundance gradient region mixes into the core, delivering signi ﬁcant quantities of fresh H.
__label__positive Such behavior is unphysical, and in Paper IVwe made the pragmatic choice to avoid this outcome by disabling predictive mixing for the convective shell.
__label__positive Additionally, the 1 MeCHeB scenario presented in Figure 6 of Paper IVexhibits ∇rad>∇adat the upper boundary of its convective core.
__label__positive This issue cannot be resolved by predictive mixing, as discussed in Paper IV.
__label__positive In both of these scenarios, the problem encountered is an unavoidable consequence of the design of the predictive mixing scheme, which manipulates the diffusion coef ﬁcients at cell faces and then relies on MESA ʼs abundance solver (Paper I, Section 6.2 )to update the model.
__label__positive In contrast, the new CPM scheme directly updates the abundances, as we now describe.
__label__positive The Convective Premixing Scheme The CPM scheme is applied at the start of each time step, before any structural or compositional changes that arise owing to the evolution of the star.
__label__positive It proceeds by ﬁnding the cells where y>0 on one face (convective )andy<0 on the other face (radiative ).
__label__positive For each of these initial boundary cells, the algorithm considers whether yon the radiative face would change if the adjacent cell outside the convection region ismixed completely with the rest of the convection region.
__label__positive This putative mixing is performed at constant cell pressure and temperature and involves recalculating abundances, densities,opacities, and the various temperature gradients (∇ rad,∇ad, ∇L)throughout the convection region plus the adjacent cell.
__label__positive If the radiative face of the boundary cell becomes convective during this putative mixing, then the mixing is committed to themodel, overwriting the composition pro ﬁle throughout the Figure 36.
__label__positive Grid of Roche equipotential surfaces for a range of rotation rates (ω)and inclination angles (i).
__label__positive The color of the surface corresponds to the variation in ˜Teff, with red corresponding to 0.87 and pale yellow to 1.25; the stars with ω=0 have ˜=T 1 eff .
__label__positive 26The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 243:10 (44pp ), 2019 July Paxton et al.
__label__positive Then, the next adjacent cell outside the convection region is considered for incorporation.
__label__positive This process continues iteratively until theradiative face of the current convective boundary remains radiative during the putative mixing.
__label__positive At a given point in its evolution, a star typically exhibits multiple convective boundaries (for instance, the left panel of Figure 39shows three ).
__label__positive The order in which CPM processes these boundaries is determined by evaluating a characteristic mixing timescale dr/v conv for the initial boundary cells; here vconvis the convective velocity on the y>0 face of the boundary cell, and dris its radial extent.
__label__positive The boundary with the smallest timescale is processed ﬁrst, then the boundary with the next-smallest timescale, and so on.
__label__positive Given that the convective diffusivity Dconvis well in excess of 1010cm2s−1 even near convective boundaries (see, e.g., Figures 11 and  29 of Paper II), the characteristic mixing timescale is τ∼Δr2/Dconv 104yr for a typical region with extent ΔrRe.
__label__positive This is small compared to typical nuclear timescales, and so the assumption of instantaneous mixing seems warranted for all but the most rapid evolutionary phases.
__label__positive During its iterations, CPM naturally handles the transition of cell faces inside the convection region from convective toradiative.
__label__positive This typically happens either at the boundary opposite to the advancing one (causing that boundary to retreat )or at a point inside the convection region (causing the region to split ).
__label__positive Because mixing through a face ceases when it transitions from convective to radiative, newly transitionedfaces should be very close to convective neutrality.
__label__positive To improve how closely neutrality is achieved, our CPM implementation divides the cell outside the advancing boundary into a numberof virtual subcells.
__label__positive Each of these subcells is mixed into theconvective region in turn, until all have been incorporated.
__label__positive The number of subcells is automatically adjusted to ensure that, during each subcell mix, at most a single face within the currentconvective region transitions to radiative.
__label__positive Evolution of a Retreating Convective Core on the Main Sequence We evolve a 16 M estar from the ZAMS to the TAMS.
__label__positive This is the scenario considered in Section 2.3 of Paper IVand illustrates the behavior of MS stars with retreating convective cores.
__label__positive Here, and for the scenarios presented in the following sections, we assume an initial He mass fraction Y=0.28 and an initial metal mass fraction Z=0.02, and we ignore rotation and mass loss.

__label__positive andXin the inner parts of the star, at a point nearing the TAMS (Xc=0.15 ).
__label__positive The left panel illustrates a run using the predictive mixing scheme applied at the boundary of the convective core, while the right panel shows a run using the CPM scheme; inboth calculations, the Ledoux criterion is used to assess convective stability, so that y=y L.
__label__positive In the left panel, the convective shell discussed in Section 5.1 can clearly be seen at the top of the abundance gradient region, spanning mass coordinates 6.2 m/Me7.1.
__label__positive In the right panel, the shell is absent and the abundance gradient region is wider andshallower, extending all the way out to m/M e≈7.2.
__label__positive Moreover, the region is very close to adiabatic (∇rad=∇ad), in contrast to the superadiabatic strati ﬁcation (∇rad>∇ad)seen in the left panel.
__label__positive Schwarzschild & Härm (1958 )were the ﬁrst to predict the appearance of adiabatically strati ﬁed abundance gradient regions outside the convective cores of massive MS stars, labeling them “semiconvection regions.
__label__positive ”The key feature of a semiconvection region is that the adiabatic strati ﬁcation is continuously maintained by a gradual adjustment of opacity due to the changing abundance pro ﬁle.
__label__positive To illustrate how this adjustment naturally arises within the CPM scheme, we simulate a single evolutionary time step of the 16 Mestar where we arti ﬁcially switch from the predictive scheme to CPM.
__label__positive The starting con ﬁguration is the pro ﬁle shown in the left panel of Figure 39.
__label__positive This panel is reproduced as the top left panel of Figure 40; the subsequent panels then show the evolving pro ﬁles at selective intermediate stages during the CPM iterations.
__label__positive A clear narrative emerges from these panels: as the lower boundary of the convective shell advances inward,the cell faces near the upper boundary of the shell transition from convective to radiative, causing that boundary to retreat inward.
__label__positive Because there are no abundance gradients withinthe shell itself, the Ledoux and Schwarzschild criteria give the same condition for this transition to occur: ∇ rad=∇ad.
__label__positive The overall effect is that the shell propagates inward as a whole, leaving behind it a “wake ”with an adiabatic strati ﬁcation.
__label__positive Eventually, the propagating shell merges with the core, leadingto aﬁnal state (seen in the bottom right panel of Figure 40)that closely resembles the right panel of Figure 39 (the small differences are because the former has an evolutionary historydetermined by the predictive mixing scheme, while the latter has a history determined by CPM ).
__label__positive The seminal paper by Schwarzschild & Härm (1958 ) triggered signi ﬁcant interest in semiconvection regions, with a particular focus on their ﬁnal strati ﬁcation.
__label__positive Sakashita & Hayashi (1961 )argued that y L=0 should apply in semi- convection regions, rather than yS=0 as originally proposed.
__label__positive However, Kato (1966 )reasoned that because the former stratiﬁcation is superadiabatic (∇rad>∇ad), slow mixing by overstable g-mode oscillations will drive it toward the samey S=0 outcome.
__label__positive Subsequently, Gabriel (1970 )suggested that Kato ʼs mechanism is super ﬂuous, due to the appearance of propagating convective shells that continually adjust theabundance pro ﬁle to achieve y S=0.
__label__positive Gabriel ʼs narrative closely mirrors the one we give above, and the correspondence between his Figure 1 and our Figure 40is striking.
__label__positive A possible source of confusion in this discussion is the relationship between the semiconvection region shown in the right panel of Figure 39and the semiconvective mixing discussed in Section 4.1 of Paper II.
__label__positive The latter implements the mixing envisaged by Kato (1966 ); while it will ultimately yield ayS=0 strati ﬁcation, it is a fundamentally different mech- anism than the propagating convective shells shown in Figure 40.
__label__positive A critical distinction lies in the role played by the convective stability criterion.
__label__positive While our calculations adopt the Ledoux criterion (y=yL), repeating them with the Schwarzschild criterion (y=yS)leads to results very similar to the ones already shown (although the abundance pro ﬁles are rather more jagged ).
__label__positive In contrast, Kato ʼs mechanism requires the Ledoux criterion to establish an initially superadiabaticstratiﬁcation, which the mechanism then drives toward adiabaticity.
__label__positive In hindsight, it seems prudent to reserve the label “semiconvection ”for the adiabatically strati ﬁed regions envisaged by Schwarzschild & Härm (1958 )and avoid using it as in Paper IIto describe a mechanism that can generate these regions (for additional examples of this con ﬂation, see, e.g., Silva Aguirre et al.

__label__positive 28The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 243:10 (44pp ), 2019 July Paxton et al.
__label__positive We also show the mass coordinate maof the top of the abundance gradient region outside the core; this coincides with the maximal extentof the core in the predictive mixing case and the top of thesemiconvection region in the CPM case.
__label__positive During the star ʼs evolution, the opacity change due to progressive H depletion atthe center lowers ∇ radthroughout the core, causing its boundary to retreat inward.
__label__positive In the CPM case, this retreat is mirrored by an outward growth of the semiconvection region, abehavior ﬁrst noted by Schwarzschild & Härm (1958 ).
__label__positive The growth slowly feeds fresh H from the envelope down into thecore, which causes the core to shrink slightly less rapidly than in the predictive mixing case, thereby marginally prolonging the star ʼs MS lifetime.
__label__positive As the star nears the TAMS, the mass m a−mcof the abundance gradient region is ≈30% larger in the CPM case than with predictive mixing.
__label__positive This region plays a key role in determining the shape of the Brunt –Väisälä frequency near the core, and the two cases should therefore exhibit d ifferences in their g-mode oscillation spectra.
__label__positive We explore this by using release 5.2 of GYRE (Townsend & Teitler 2013; Townsend et al.

__label__positive period spacing ΔP) for ℓ=2 g-modes in the period range 0.5 –5 days.
__label__positive Both cases show signi ﬁcant departures from the uniform period spacing ΔP≈104s predicted by asymptotic theory; these departures are caused by the abundance gradient region and therefore are anasteroseismic diagnostic of the star ʼsa g e (e.g., Miglio et al.
__label__positive As the ﬁgure shows, the CPM scheme yields signi ﬁcantly smaller nonuniformity in ΔPforP2 days than the predictive mixing scheme.
__label__positive These different outcome s are potentially testable by the TESS mission (Ricker et al.
__label__positive 2016 ), which will observe many massive stars, some with the lon g time baselines necessary to detect g-modes with multiday periods.
__label__positive It will ﬁrst be necessary to explore whether the differences pe rsist when the additional effects of core overshoot and rotation are included.
__label__positive Evolution of the Convective Core during Core He Burning We now evolve a 1 M estar through the CHeB phase; this is the scenario considered in Section 2.4 of Paper IVand illustrates the behavior of He-burning stars with growingconvective cores.
__label__positive Figure 43plots the pro ﬁles of∇ rad,∇ad, and Yin the inner parts of the star, at three points during itsevolution corresponding to Yc=0.9, 0.6, and 0.3.
__label__positive The left panels show a run using the predictive mixing scheme, whilethe right panels show a run using the CPM scheme; in both calculations, the Ledoux criterion is used to assess convective stability.
__label__positive The left panels, which reprise Figure 6 of Paper IV, show how a local minimum in ∇ radhas developed by Yc=0.6.
__label__positive This minimum is held just above the ∇adthreshold using the predictive _superad _thresh control, with the result that the core continues to grow slowly without splitting.
__label__positive With the CPM scheme, a growing semiconvection region develops above a smaller convective core.
__label__positive The emergence of semiconvection regions during the CHeB phase may have ﬁrst been proposed by Schwarzschild and Härm (1969 ), but it was Castellani et al.
__label__positive (1971 )and Eggleton (1972 )who considered the possibility in detail.
__label__positive (1985 )described a “concatenated convective mixings ”scheme for simulating the formation of the semiconvection region; their Figure 3, which can be regardedas a CHeB analog to our Figure 40, reveals how the core splits to form a convective shell, which then propagates outward, leaving a wake with an adiabatic strati ﬁcation.
__label__positive Mowlavi & Forestini (1994 )demonstrated how the Castellani et al.
__label__positive (1985 ) scheme can be generalized to work in other evolutionary phases, and together these two papers provided the originalinspiration for the CPM scheme.
__label__positive To summarize the core and near-core evolution of the 1 M e star, Figure 44plots the mass coordinate mcof the convective core boundary as a function of CHeB age, for the separate runs using the predictive mixing and CPM schemes.
__label__positive For the CPM run, we also show the mass coordinate maof the top of the abundance gradient region outside the core; there is noabundance gradient region in the predictive mixing run.
__label__positive The ﬁgure shows that the semiconvection region forms in the CPM run at an age of ≈25 Myr.
__label__positive The top of the semiconvec- tion region then closely tracks the outward growth of the core boundary from the predictive mixing run, through to an age of≈95 Myr.
__label__positive At this juncture, oscillations start to occur in m c for the CPM run.
__label__positive These oscillations are due to breathing pulses, which disrupt the semiconvection region and introduce discontinuities in the abundance pro ﬁle.
__label__positive Because mabecomes ill-de ﬁned when the discontinuities appear, we do not plot it beyond this point.
__label__positive After two ﬁnal, large- amplitude pulses, the star re aches the end of the CHeB at an age of ≈125 Myr, slightly later than the ﬁnal age for the predictive mixing run.
__label__positive Debate continues as to whether core breathing pulses during the CHeB phase are physical or numerical (see, e.g., Salaris & Cassisi 2017, and references therein ).
__label__positive In the present context, we note that the instantaneous mixing assumed in the CPM scheme will tend to exacerbate the pulses, because it does not accountfor the ﬁnite time required for He ingested at the top of the semiconvection region to be transported down to the core.
__label__positive We are currently considering improvements that address thisshortcoming, but in the meantime we recommend that theCPM scheme be used with caution in the late stages (Y c0.15 )of the CHeB phase.

__label__positive The left panel illustrates a run using the predictive mixing scheme,while the right panel shows a run using the CPM scheme; inboth calculations, the Ledoux criterion is used to assessconvective stability.
__label__positive The left panel shows a small superadiabatic region just outside the core that is stabilized against convection by theabundance gradient (∇ ad<∇rad<∇L).
__label__positive If slow mixing via the Kato (1966 )mechanism were allowed to proceed, this regionwould eventually transform into a semiconvection region.
__label__positive The right panel shows that the CPM scheme naturally reproduces this semiconvection region.
__label__positive Ledoux (1947 )suggests the existence of this semiconvection region (though not labeled as such ).
__label__positive The mean molecular weight pro ﬁleμ∝mp7/5he obtains for the abundance gradient region outside the coreyields an adiabatic strati ﬁcation (∇ rad=∇ad).

__label__positive In the predictive mixing case, this region ﬁrst appears at an age of ≈1.5 Gyr, when the core boundary reverses direction and begins to retreat inward.
__label__positive In the CPM case, the abundance gradient region is present from the startand coincides with the semiconvection region up until an age≈1.75 Gyr.
__label__positive At this point, ∇ radoutside the core drops below ∇ad, and the semiconvection region becomes radiative; then, without any further ingestion of H from the envelope, ma remains ﬁxed.
__label__positive Parallel Performance Here we provide updates on the parallel performance of MESAstar .
__label__positive For each test, simulations with different numbers of parallel threads were performed on the same computer with no other CPU-intensive tasks taking place.
__label__positive The tests wereperformed on one Intel Xeon E5-2699V4 processor with 22 physical cores.
__label__positive Although this processor allows hyperthreading (i.e., two threads running on one physical core ), we restrict these tests to one thread per physical core because tests found that enabling hyperthreading results in a performance penalty rather than a bene ﬁt.
__label__positive Parallel Scaling of MESAstar MESA uses the OpenMP application programming interface to parallelize certain operations.
__label__positive The ﬁrst category is operations that are parallel per cell in the stellar model, including the EOS, opacity, and nuclear network.
__label__positive The next category concerns partsof the problem that are a mixture of parallel and serialexecution.
__label__positive These include matrix manipulations, the Newton – Raphson solver, and atomic diffusion calculations.
__label__positive The ﬁnal category is those operations that are serial, such as the mainevolve loop and the adjustment of the total mass of the star via mass loss or accretion.
__label__positive Three MESA test _suite cases are considered: black _ hole ,7M_prems _to_agb, and 1M_pre_ms_to_wd.
__label__positive 25The black _hole test uses six structure variables and a nuclear network with 22 isotopes.
__label__positive The 7M_prems _to_AGB test uses four structure variables and a nuclear network with 10 isotopes.
__label__positive The1M_pre_ms_to_wdtest uses four structure variables and a nuclear network with eight isotopes and includes rotation.
__label__positive As a metric, we de ﬁne“speedup ”to be the ratio of the measured run time on 1 thread to that on Nthreads.
__label__positive The theoretical speedup, () ( )()-+pp s1 1,4 6 is predicted by Amdahl (1967 ), where, for our purposes, sis the number of parallel threads and pis the fraction of the code that will bene ﬁt from parallel execution for a given test case.
__label__positive Figure 47shows the speedup for each of the three cases.
__label__positive In general, we expect cases with more variables (both structure and network )to bene ﬁt more from parallel execution.
__label__positive Indeed, theblack _hole case shows the best scalability with p≈0.96, followed by 7M_prems _to_AGB with p≈0.90 and1M_pre_ms_to_wdwith p≈0.81.
__label__positive These results areconsistent with the numbers of variables included in the respective tests.
__label__positive For each case, Figure 48shows the relative fraction for the three categories described above and the speedup.
__label__positive The parts ofMESAstar that are parallel-per-cell scale nearly linearly with the number of threads, while the mixed category scales weaklyand the serial component is essentially ﬂat.
__label__positive The serial portion becomes an increasing fraction of the total run time as the other categories decrease with an increasing number of parallel threads.
__label__positive This may become a greater issue with the move towardmany-core processors in the future.
__label__positive OP Monochromatic Opacities and Radiative Levitation Paper III (Section 9 )describes the inclusion of radiative levitation in MESA via the work of Hu et al.
__label__positive These capabilities were originally developed as part of STARS (Eggleton 1971; Pols et al.
__label__positive 1995 )and evaluate the opacity and radiative acceleration using the OP monochromatic opacity tables (Seaton 2005 ).
__label__positive Due to the differing approaches of STARS andMESA , a number of derivatives were being calculated but not used in the MESA implementation of the opacity routines.
__label__positive By eliminating the evaluation of these unusedquantities, and by pre-computing some frequently reusedstimulated emission factors, we achieved at least a factor of 5reduction in the time required to evaluate opacities andradiative accelerations.
__label__positive These optimizations translate into animprovement in total run time relative to previous versions of MESA when making use of the OP monochromatic opacities or radiative levitation capabilities without any compromise to thenumerical results.
__label__positive We demonstrate in Figure 49the difference in execution time for runs of the radiative _levitation test suite case using MESA versions before and after the changes described herein.
__label__positive The computational expense of calculatingthe radiative accelerations continues to dominate the run timeof such models, accounting for more than 65% of run time evenwhen using 20 parallel threads, meaning that these capabilities can bene ﬁt from progress toward many-core architectures.Figure 44.

__label__positive Equation of State The EOS is evaluated by the eos module.
__label__positive Figure 50shows the default coverage in the ρ–Tplane.
__label__positive The new PTEH option extends the eos coverage to lower densities (to 10−18gc m−3) and higher metallicities (Zup to 1.0 )than allowed by OPAL (ρ10−10gc m−3andZ0.04 only ).
__label__positive Previous versions of eos use HELM to provide approximate results for the low- density or Z>0.04 cases now covered by PTEH.
__label__positive The PTEH tables are created using the approach of Pols et al.
__label__positive (1995 )as implemented by Paxton (2004 )in a program derived from Eggleton (1971 ).
__label__positive PTEH includes a solution to the Saha equations to obtain the dissociation and ionization stages H+, H, H 2, He, He+, and He++and assumes full ionization of C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe.
__label__positive In addition to PTEH, there are two other new eosoptions, DT2 and ELM.26These are motivated by the need for more numerically accurate partials as discussed in Section 3.
__label__positive In this context, the desired numerical accuracy of the partials is achieved by evaluatinganalytic partials of the interpo lating polynomials rather than by interpolating values of tabulated partials (as is done with OPAL and SCVH data in MESA ).
__label__positive As a result, the partials correspond to how the interpolated eos values will actually change in response to small changes of the parameters, whereas interpolated values of partials will be less accurate pr edictors of the response to such variations.
__label__positive All three new options us e bicubic spline interpolation in high-resolution tables of (ploggas/erg cm−3), (elog/erg g−1),a n d (slog/erg g−1K−1)to obtain ﬁrst and second partial derivatives ofthese quantities with respect to log (ρ/gc m−3)andlog (T/K).T h e options DT2 and ELM use tables holding values derived from OPAL /SCVH and HELM, respectively.
__label__positive Figure 51shows∇adin a region of the ρ–Tplane covered by DT2 and PTEH.
__label__positive Blending The control structure for blending the various EOS sources in Figure 50considers a particular source EOS (PTEH, PC, HELM, etc.
__label__positive )to determine what fraction fof the ﬁnal result comes from that source.
__label__positive (1995 ), HELM is from Timmes & Swesty (2000 ), PC is from Potekhin & Chabrier (2010 ), OPAL is from Rogers & Nayfonov (2002 ), SCVH is from Saumon et al.
__label__positive (1995 ), and the low-density cold region in the lower left is treated as an ideal neutral gas.
__label__positive The region between SCVH and PC is currently problematic from input physics and numerical perspectives andtreated as an ideal gas (see Chabrier et al.
__label__positive 2019 for a recent treatment that is not yet in MESA ).
__label__positive The blue curve shows the pro ﬁle of a 25 M estar that has reached an iron core infall speed of 1000 km s−1, and the purple curve shows the pro ﬁle of a 0.8 MeWD.
__label__positive Adiabatic gradient in the ρ–Tplane for X=0.70 and Z=0.02.
__label__positive Regions undergoing H 2, H, He, or He+dissociation /ionization are colored blue and labeled.
__label__positive Previous versions of eos truncated the H 2dissociation region at log(ρ/gc m−3)=−10, the limit of the SCVH data in eos.
__label__positive Other ionization bands occur at a high enough temperature to be mainly covered by OPAL.
__label__positive 26DT2 is a second way to access OPAL /SCVH data using density and temperature.

__label__positive Otherwise, call level 2,blend result with that of PTEH, and return.
__label__positive Level 2: Iff PC=0, then return result of level 3.
__label__positive If fPC=1, then evaluate PC and return result to level 1.
__label__positive Otherwise, call level 3, blend result with that of PC, and return the blended result to level 1.
__label__positive Level 3: IffPTEH,Z =0(i.e.,Z0.04 ), then call level 4 with DT2 and return the result to level 2.
__label__positive If fPTEH,Z =1(i.e., Z0.04 ), then call level 4 with PTEH and return the result to level 2.
__label__positive Otherwise (i.e.,Znear 0.04 ), call level 4 with each of DT2 and PTEH, blend the result in Z and return the blended result to level 2.
__label__positive Level 4: IffPTEH /DT2 =0, then return result of level 5.
__label__positive If fPTEH /DT2 =1, then evaluate PTEH /DT227and return result to level 3.
__label__positive Otherwise, call level 5, blend the result with that of PTEH /DT2, and return the blended result to level 3.
__label__positive Level 5: IffELM =0, then return result of level 6.
__label__positive If fELM =1, then evaluate ELM and return result to level 4.
__label__positive Otherwise,call level 6, blend the result with that of ELM, and return the blended result to level 4.
__label__positive Level 6: Evaluate HELM and return result to level 5.
__label__positive The blends use a quintic polynomial with zero slope at boundaries.
__label__positive The partial derivatives of the blend polynomial are included in the calculation of the ﬁnal result to maintain high numerical consistency in the blend region and across EOSregion boundaries.
__label__positive There remain challenges to providing a broad coverage EOS given the current need to combine multiple sources, some of which may not provide the necessary thermodynamic informa- tion.
__label__positive For example, when the (rlog/gc m−3)blend region extended from 3.0 to 3.1, a negative χρ,gasresulted because (ploggas/erg cm−3)from DT2 were slightly greater than (ploggas/erg cm−3)from ELM.
__label__positive This could give a drop in pgasas (rlog/gc m−3)transitions from DT2 to ELM.
__label__positive Extending the blend region from 2.98 to 3.12 is enough to ensure χρ,gas>0 in the DT2-to-ELM transition.
__label__positive Numerical Accuracy of Partials To check the numerical accuracy of partials using the new options, we have compared their results with iterativelyacquired high-precision numerical derivatives (Ridders 1982; Press et al.
__label__positive For example, Figure 52shows the relative difference between the eos derivative and a Richardson iterative numerical derivative across the ρ–Tplane for χ ρ,gas.
__label__positive The right panel shows that new options give relative errors of ;10−7, while the left panel shows that the previous options have larger errors, particularly in the OPAL /SCVH regions.
__label__positive As mentioned in Section 3, those larger errors limit the ability of theMESAstar Newton –Raphson solver to reduce residuals, and that in turn can lead to increased errors in numerical energyconservation.

__label__positive Thermodynamic inconsistency may manifest itself as an arti ﬁcial buildup or decay of the entropy during what should be an adiabatic ﬂow.
__label__positive Models that are sensitive to the entropy may suffer inaccuracies if thermodynamic consistency is Figure 52.
__label__positive Relative difference in χρ,gasbetween the eos derivative and a Richardson-limit-based numerical derivative across the ρ–Tplane.
__label__positive The left panel shows the results for the OPAL /SCVH and HELM options, and the right panel shows the results for the PTEH, DT2, and ELM options.
__label__positive Relative differences for the new eos options are ;10−7, except for a region between SCVH and PC.
__label__positive Note the large difference in accuracy between the old OPAL /SCVH options using interpolated partials and the new DT2 option using partials of interpolating polynomials.
__label__positive There are separate level 4 routines for PTEH and DT2.
__label__positive 36The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 243:10 (44pp ), 2019 July Paxton et al.

__label__positive 48TY Y YY TY Y2 ,, ,, 2 , ,ii ii i i Ideally, dpe,dse, and dsp are zero.
__label__positive Figure 53shows the ﬁrst thermodynamic consistency quantity, dpe, across the ρ–T plane for an older (MESA r8845 )and current version of eos.
__label__positive The other two thermodynamic consistency metrics, dse and dsp, show similar magnitudes.
__label__positive In general, the thermodynamic consistency with DT2 and ELM is reduced relative to the olderoptions directly using OPAL /SCVH and HELM.
__label__positive This is because the thermodynamic consistency relations can only be approximated by bicubic splines.
__label__positive If possible, Hermite inter-polation of the Helmholtz free energy would make use ofpartial derivatives from the EOS and guarantee thermodynamicconsistency (e.g., Timmes & Swesty 2000 ).
__label__positive However, a bicubic Hermite interpolation produces discontinuities in second-derivative quantities (e.g., ∣r¶¶p TY gas ,i)that are problematic forMESA ʼs Newton –Raphson solver, and a biquintic Hermite interpolation requires partial derivatives that are unavailablefrom some constituents of the EOS patchwork.
__label__positive So for now, wecompromise by providing the previous options that give betterthermodynamic consistency and the new options that providebetter numerical accuracy of partials.
__label__positive The impact of thethermodynamic inconsistencies of the new approach must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.A.2.
__label__positive Nuclear Reaction Rates The Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA ) REACLIB library, which provides the default nuclear reactionrates for MESA , has been updated from the jina_reaclib _ results _v2.2 snapshot to the default snapshot.
__label__positive 28This update includes changes to the ﬁtting formula for a few neutron capture rates that previously returned erroneous values atT8×109K.
__label__positive We have modi ﬁed the default snapshot to include a missing, temperature-independent Al Mg26 26 weak reaction rate.
__label__positive Reaction rates between the26Al ground and meta-stable states now use Gupta & Meyer (2001 ).
__label__positive Nuclear partition functions use JINA winvne _v2.0.dat table29and JINA masslib _library _5.data30provides atomic masses.
__label__positive A cell ʼs temperature may exceed ()Tlog K =10.0 in shocks and explosive burning, which is beyond the range of validityfor the ﬁts to the reaction rates and the partition functions.
__label__positive Previously, MESA extrapolated for ()Tlog K >10.0, leading to erroneous reaction rates.
__label__positive Reaction rates are now set equal totheir ()Tlog K =10.0 values when ()Tlog K >10.0.
__label__positive MESA now includes the option to use the electron-capture andβ-decay rates from Suzuki et al.
__label__positive (2016 ), which cover sd- shell nuclei with A=17–28.
__label__positive The primary application for these tables is the evolution of high-density oxygen-neon cores (e.g., Miyaji et al.
__label__positive Compared to the on-the- ﬂy weak-rate approach described in Paper III, these tabulated rates are less computationally expensive and more accurate at high temperatures (T109K) but less accurate at low temperatures (T108K)and do not allow explicit updating of nuclear physics.
__label__positive Thermodynamic consistency metric dpe; see Equation (48)for the de ﬁnition.
__label__positive The left panel shows the results for OPAL /SCVH and HELM, and the right panel shows the results for PTEH, DT2, and ELM.
__label__positive As expected, HELM gives machine-precision consistency and so is superior in this to ELM.
__label__positive OPAL and SCVHhave an advantage over DT2 because they use interpolated values of thermodynamically consistent partials —which degrades their numerical accuracy as shown in Figure 52.

__label__positive Previous versions defaulted to using one set of expressions for the weak screening regime (Γi,j0.3; Dewitt et al.
__label__positive 1973 )and another set of expressions for the strong screening regime (Γi,j0.8, Alastuey & Jancovici 1978; Itoh et al.
__label__positive A linear blend of the weak and strong screening factors is used in the0.3 <Γ i,j<0.8 intermediate regime.
__label__positive Silicon-burning reactions in the cores of massive stars often operate in this intermediate regime.
__label__positive The numerical blending provides a smooth andcontinuous function that equals the nonblended values andtheir derivatives at the edges.
__label__positive A new default for screening,based on Chugunov et al.

__label__positive These are used for the computation of centrifugal effects in stellar structure, as discussed in Section 4.
__label__positive Through these derivations we denote dimensionless propertiesusing an apostrophe, with distances being normalized as ()¢= W Y r rG m21 3and the potential as ()Y¢=Y W YGm23.

__label__positive Modi ﬁcations since Paper IVhave focused on fallback in weak explosions of red supergiant(RSG )stars.
__label__positive In these weak explosions, the total ﬁnal explosion energy is positive but insuf ﬁcient to unbind all material.
__label__positive Thus, some material falls back onto the central object during the 40The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 243:10 (44pp ), 2019 July Paxton et al.
__label__positive To quantify and remove this material, we introduce two new user controls.
__label__positive First, we implement a new criterion to select which material is excised from the model during the ejecta evolution.31At each time step, MESA calculates the integrated total energy from the innermost cell to cell jabove it: ⎛ ⎝⎜⎞ ⎠⎟ () å=- + =EeGm rud m1 2.7 8 j ij ii ii i inner2 IfEj<0, then there is a bound inner region, and MESA continues this sum outward until it reaches a cell kwith local positive total energy (-+ >eG m ru 20 kk k k2).MESA removes material inside this cell, making cell kthe new innermost cell.
__label__positive Second, to remove any slow-moving, nearlyhydrostatic material left near the inner boundary, a minimuminnermost velocity can be speci ﬁed at handoff to STELLA .
__label__positive All material below the innermost cell that has a velocity above thisspeciﬁed velocity is not included in STELLA input ﬁles.
__label__positive 32A velocity cut between 100 and 500 km s−1has little effect on light-curve properties and the photospheric evolution of SNe IIP and can greatly reduce numerical artifacts that may arise from an inward-propagating shock hitting the inner boundaryinSTELLA .
__label__positive Such a cut can also lead to a factor of 10 or more reduction in the number of time steps required to produce alight curve.
__label__positive While this scheme is useful in quantifying andexcising fallback material, it is not a satisfactory treatment offallback.
__label__positive For a more complete description of these fallbackcriteria, see Appendix A of Goldberg et al.
__label__positive Next, we look at the evolution of material deep within the ejecta of an SN IIP, at such large optical depths that the outcome is not sensitive to any particular treatment of radiation transport in different software instruments.
__label__positive For this restricted regime, we compare results using MESA+STELLA to quantities derived from the open-source 1D gray radiation hydrodynamics codeSNEC (Morozova et al.
__label__positive 2015 ), both using the same MESA Type IIP ejecta model at shock breakout.
__label__positive This should yieldmeaningful density and velocity comparisons nearly every- where in the ejecta and meaningful temperature comparisons very deep within the ejecta.
__label__positive We explode (with E exp=1051erg )the 99em_19 RSG progenitor model from Paper IV, which has a ZAMS mass of 19Meand a mass of 17.8 Meand a radius of 603 Reat time of explosion.
__label__positive We excise the inner 1.5 Meand explode the remaining 16.3 Meof ejecta using a thermal bomb as described in Paper IV.
__label__positive The mass of radioactive56Ni is set to MNi=0.03 Me.
__label__positive The resulting ejecta is in ﬂuenced by the inclusion of the Duffell (2016 )prescription for mixing due to the Rayleigh –Taylor instability in MESA .
__label__positive We then pass our MESA models at shock breakout to both STELLA andSNEC .
__label__positive To mimic the additional line opacities from metals, SNEC employs an opacity ﬂoor.
__label__positive We use SNEC ʼs default opacity ﬂoor recommended in Bersten et al.
__label__positive (2011 ), which is set to κﬂoor,core =0.24 cm2g−1for the metal-rich core material, κﬂoor,envelope =0.01 cm2g−1for the envelope, and proportional to metallicity for the intermediate region.

__label__positive evolution is also in agreement in the very optically thick inner ejecta.
__label__positive Temperature differences at the surface re ﬂect the differing treatments of opacity and radiation transfer between SNEC andSTELLA .
__label__positive Figure 57focuses on the deep core during the ﬁrst days of the evolution after shock breakout at the location of the reverseshock generated at the H /He boundary of the initial model.
__label__positive Density, velocity, and temperature pro ﬁles over the ﬁrst 20 days are plotted with the corresponding MESA proﬁle at shock breakout, which serves as the common input in both STELLA andSNEC .
__label__positive By day 20 the reverse shock has reached the inner boundary in both models.
__label__positive Although there are slightdifferences within the ﬁrst day, both instruments agree on global properties of the reverse shock and its effects on the temperature and density pro ﬁles out to day 20.
__label__positive Appendix D MESA Testhub Development of the MESA source code is a collaborative process with multiple commits each day from developersworking on separate parts of the codebase.
__label__positive In addition to serving as starting templates for science projects, the test cases inMESAstar andMESAbinary exist to detect when changes to the codebase cause unintended deviations from expected behavior (i.e., bugs ).
__label__positive The number of test cases grows with time and is currently more than 100, with a total run time on theorder of 10 hr on multicore workstations.
__label__positive Since MESA is committed to supporting reproducibility by giving bit-for-bit identical results on a variety of different hardware and softwareplatforms (Paper III, Section 10 ), the test suite must be checked on a representative sample of host systems; just as it takes a team to create MESA , it takes a team to test it.
__label__positive To prevent slowdowns in development that would be caused by running the test suite on multiple hosts before every commit, we have developed the MESA Testhub (https://testhub.
__label__positive The Testhub is a web application that collects and organizes the results of test suite submissions via a companion Ruby gem called mesa _test .
__label__positive Every day, submissions from multiple computers and clusters with diversehardware, operating systems, and compilers check out the most recent revision of MESA , run the test suite, and upload their results to the Testhub.
__label__positive Each day, a summary email is sent todevelopers detailing which, if any, revisions had failing testcases submitted in the previous 24 hr.
__label__positive With a quick check of the daily email from the Testhub, developers are able to detect cases that fail to give the expected output with bit-for-bitidentical results on different computers, or take more than the speciﬁ ed number of time steps, retries, or backups.
__label__positive With daily coverage, we can promptly diagnose issues as soon as theyarise by looking at changes from only a handful of commits while maintaining a brisk development pace.
__label__positive The addition of the Testhub has yielded a signi ﬁcant improvement in the pace and quality of MESA development.

__label__positive Received 2017 May 22; in original form 2017 March 1 ABSTRACT Double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are expected to be very common in the Milky Way, but their intrinsic faintness challenges the detection of these systems.
__label__positive Currently, only a few tens ofdetached DWDs are know.
__label__positive Such systems offer the best chance of extracting the physical properties that would allow us to address a wealth of outstanding questions ranging from the nature of white dwarfs and thermonuclear supernovae, over stellar and binary evolution to mapping the Galaxy.
__label__positive In this paper, we explore the prospects for detections of ultra-compact (with binary separations of a few solar radii or less) detached DWDs in (1) optical radiation with Gaia and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and (2) gravitational wave radiation with Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LISA).
__label__positive We show that Gaia , LSST and LISA have the potential to detect, respectively, around a few hundred, a thousand and 25 thousand DWD systems.
__label__positive Moreover, Gaia and LSST data will extend by, respectively, a factor of 2 and 7 the guaranteed sample of LISA veriﬁcation sources, binaries detectable in electromagnetic and gravitational wave radiation, opening the era of multimessenger astronomy for these sources.
__label__positive Key words: gravitational waves – binaries: close – binaries: eclipsing – white dwarfs.
__label__positive 1 INTRODUCTION On the basis of our theoretical understanding of stellar and binary evolution, systems of two white dwarfs in a close binary were pre- dicted since 1980s (thereafter double white dwarf (DWD) binaries) (Tutukov & Yungelson 1981 ; Iben & Tutukov 1984b ; Webbink 1984 ; Tutukov & Yungelson 1988 ; Iben, Tutukov & Yungelson 1997 ; Han 1998 ; Nelemans et al.
__label__positive 2000 ,2001a ; Toonen, Nelemans & Portegies Zwart 2012 ).
__label__positive However, due to their intrinsic faint- ness, the ﬁrst detection came only a decade later in 1988 (Saffer, Liebert & Olszewski 1988 ).
__label__positive The current census counts a few tens of DWDs discovered by spectroscopic and variability surveys such as the SPY (ESO SN Ia Progenitor) survey (e.g.
__label__positive 2003 ), the ELM (Extremely Low Mass WDs) survey (e.g.
__label__positive 2010 ) and studies by Marsh ( 1995 ), Marsh, Dhillon & Duck (1995 ), Maxted & Marsh ( 1999 ) and Badenes et al.
__label__positive Still, these represent only a fraction of the DWD binaries predicted in numerical simulations (Toonen et al.
__label__positive Substantial progress in the detection of these sources is ex- pected with optical wide surveys such as Gaia (Gaia Collabora- ⋆E-mail: korol@strw.leidenuniv.nltion et al.
__label__positive 2016 ) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) (LSST Science Collaboration et al.
__label__positive 2009 ), and in gravitational waves (GWs) with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mis- sion (Amaro-Seoane et al.
__label__positive All three instruments will be sensitive to short period ( P<a few days) binaries (e.g.
__label__positive 2014 ) and will provide a large sample of new ultra-compact DWDs that are interesting for several reasons.
__label__positive First, compact DWDs are systems that experienced at least two phases of mass transfer and thus provide a good test for binary evolution models, and, in particular, for our understanding of mass transfer and the common envelope (CE) phase.
__label__positive Secondly, DWDs are the plausible progenitors to a wide range of interesting systems: Type Ia supernovae (Iben & Tutukov 1984a ; Webbink 1984 ) that are used as cosmological distance indicators (e.g.
__label__positive 2001a ; Marsh, Nelemans & Steeghs 2004 ; Solheim 2010 ) and ‘fast optical transients’ including Ia supernovae, Ca-rich transients and fast/bright transients (Bild- sten et al.

__label__positive Finally, detached DWD binaries with orbital periods in the range from 1-h to a few minutes are particularly suitable for study- ing the physics of tides, a phenomenon directly related to the WD internal properties.
__label__positive The study of the reaction of the stellar inter- nal structure to tidal forces may give us important information, for example, on the WD viscosity and its origin, that will complete our knowledge on the WD interior matter (Piro 2011 ; Fuller & Lai 2012 ; Dall’Osso & Rossi 2014 ; McKernan & Ford 2016 ).
__label__positive In this paper, we compute the size of a sample of Galactic ultra- compact detached DWD binaries that could be observed with future facilities in the next two decades.
__label__positive In particular, we predict the size (likewise Cooray, Farmer & Seto 2004 ; Littenberg et al.
__label__positive 2013 ; Shah, Nelemans & van der Sluys 2013 ) and properties of the sample that will be observed in both electromagnetic (EM) and GW radiation byGaia , LSST and LISA: despite the widespread expectation that those instruments will represent major step forward, quantitative predictions have never been published.
__label__positive We characterize the physical properties of these samples and compare them to current data.
__label__positive In Section 2, we will describe the method we use to simulate the Galactic population of DWDs.
__label__positive In Section 3, we will estimate how many binaries can be detected with Gaia and LSST as eclipsing sources.
__label__positive In Section 4, we will focus on the GW emission from these sources and we assess the prospects for detections by the upcoming LISA mission.
__label__positive In Section 5, we will present and characterize the sample of DWDs detectable through EM and GW radiation.
__label__positive Finally, we will discuss our results and possible synergies between GW and EM observations.
__label__positive 2 SIMULATED DWD POPULATION To obtain a model sample of the Galactic DWD population, we use the binary population synthesis code SEBA, developed by Portegies Zwart & Verbunt ( 1996 , for updates see Nelemans et al.
__label__positive The initial stellar population is obtained from a Monte Carlo–based approach, assuming a binary fraction of 50 per cent and distributions of the initial binary parameters in Table 1.
__label__positive In particular, we draw the mass of single stars from the Kroupa initial mass function (IMF; Kroupa et al.
__label__positive The mass of the secondary star is drawn from a ﬂat mass ratio distribution.
__label__positive This is a poorly constrained relationship that, in general, depends on the stellar population.
__label__positive A typical progenitor of a DWD compo- nent is an A-type star (De Rosa et al.
__label__positive For this stellar type, aﬂat mass ratio distribution is a good ﬁrst-order approximation when comparing to observations (Duch ˆene & Kraus 2013 ).
__label__positive The orbit ec- centricity is drawn from a thermal distribution expected from an en- ergy equipartition argument and often recovered from observations (Heggie 1975 ;R a g h a v a ne ta l .
__label__positive Besides, DWDs lose the mem- ory of the initial orbital eccentricity because they circularize at quite early stages of their evolution, thus the shape of the initial eccentric- ity distribution hardly inﬂuences our simulation.
__label__positive The most common assumptions for the binary orbital period (or semimajor axis) dis- tribution are logarithmically ﬂat and lognormal.
__label__positive For intermediate- mass and solar-mass stars, both are consistent with observations (e.g.
__label__positive Poveda, Allen & Hern ´andez-Alc ´antara 2007 ;R a g h a v a ne ta l .
__label__positive 2010 ;D u c h ˆene & Kraus 2013 ; Tokovinin, Mason & Hartkopf 2014 ).
__label__positive The largest differences between the two are expected for both very short or for very long period systems, but such systems are not likely to be progenitors of a typical DWD.
__label__positive (2017 , see tables 4 and 5) do not ﬁnd signiﬁcantly different num- bers of DWDs when performing simulations (analogous to ours) with both logarithmically ﬂat and lognormal distributions.
__label__positive There- fore, in our simulation, we adopt a logarithmically ﬂat distribution.
__label__positive Finally, for each binary we assign an inclination angle i,d r a w n from the uniform distribution in cos i.
__label__positive We explore the sensitivity of these assumptions by performing simulations for different choice of the IMF and mass ratio relation.
__label__positive We discuss the impact of our assumptions in Section 6.
__label__positive To take into account the star formation history of the Galaxy, we exploit a code originally developed by Nelemans et al.
__label__positive ( 2001a ), Nelemans, Yungelson & Portegies Zwart ( 2004 ) and updated by Toonen & Nelemans ( 2013 ).
__label__positive The code distributes binaries according to a Galactic model with two components: disc and bulge.
__label__positive The density of DWDs in the disc is given by P(R,t,z )=ρBP(R,t)sech2/parenleftbiggz zh/parenrightbigg pc−3, (1) where 0 ≤R≤19 kpc is the cylindrical radius from the Galac- tic Centre, ρBPis the result of the integration in Randtof the plane-projected star formation rate (SFR) from Boissier & Prantzos (1999 ),zis height above the disc, zh=300 pc is the disc scaleheight and the age of the Galaxy is assumed to be 13.5 Gyr (Juri ´ce ta l .
__label__positive We neglect the dependence on the stellar age and mass when assigning z, and we assume that there is no radial migration of the stars in time.
__label__positive We model the Galactic bulge by doubling the SFR in the inner 3 kpc of the Galaxy and distributing sources spherically: ρbulge(r)∝e(r/rb)2pc−3, (2) where ris the spherical distance from the Galactic Centre and rb=0.5 kpc is the characteristic radius of the bulge (Sofue, Honma & Omodaka 2009 ; Binney & Tremaine 2011 ).
__label__positive We normalize equa- tion (2) such that the total mass of the bulge at t=13.5 Gyr is 2.6×1010M⊙.
__label__positive The resulting distribution of DWDs at different Galactic ages is represented in Fig.

__label__positive To convert rmagnitudes into Gaia G magnitude, we applied a colour–colour polynomial transformation with coefﬁcients according to Carrasco et al.
__label__positive Finally, for our simulation, we apply a magnitude limit of r=70 and a period limit of P=20 d.
__label__positive The magnitude limit is chosen to ensure that the simulated population can also be used for the GW detection simulations.
__label__positive There are at least two phases of mass transfer in the standard picture of formation of a DWD system.
__label__positive To form a short-period DWD binary, at least one mass transfer phase needs to be a CE (Paczynski 1976 ; Webbink 1984 ).
__label__positive In our simulation, we adopt two evolutionary scenarios, with two different treatments of the CE phase: the ααand the γαscenarios.
__label__positive In the ααscenario, the CE phase is described by the so-called α-formalism (see Ivanova et al.
__label__positive In this prescription, the CE outcome is determined by the conservation of the orbital energy (Webbink 1984 ), where αrepresents the efﬁciency in the exchange of the orbital energy and the binding energy of the envelope, described by another free parameter of the model λ.
__label__positive The two parameters can be combined using equations (2) and (3) of Toonen & Nelemans ( 2013 )t oa single unknown αλ.
__label__positive In the second scenario, proposed in order to explain properties of observed DWDs, the CE is described by an alternative γparametrization (Nelemans et al.
__label__positive In theγ-formalism, the binary orbital evolution is driven by angularmomentum loss that is carried away through the mass-loss process, andγis the efﬁciency of this mechanism.
__label__positive In the γαprescription, theγ-formalism is applied whenever a binary does not contain a compact object or when the CE is not driven by a tidal instability, in which case, the αprescription is used.
__label__positive Thus, in the γαscenario, the ﬁrst CE is typically described by the γformalism and the second by the αformalism.
__label__positive For this scenario, we assume the value of the αλas in the ααCE model and γ=1.75 (Nelemans et al.
__label__positive The main differences between the two populations obtained with these different prescriptions are the total number of bina- ries and their mass ratio distribution.
__label__positive Using the γαmodel, one typically obtains twice as many binaries compared to the ααsce- nario.
__label__positive Moreover, the mass ratio distribution in the γαspans a wider range of values, which agrees better with the currently observed DWD population, while the majority of the population formed viaααscenario will show mass ratios around 0.5 (see Toonen et al.
__label__positive This is due to the fact that in the αpre- scription, the orbit always shrinks signiﬁcantly.
__label__positive When using the γprescription, the CE outcome heavily depends on the binary mass ratio (see e.g.
__label__positive 2001a ): for a roughly equal mass binary, the orbit does not change much, how- ever, for a binary with very different mass components, the orbit shrinks strongly.
__label__positive 3 EM DETECTION In this section, we focus our analysis on two instruments: Gaia and the LSST.
__label__positive Being photometric variability surveys, both are expected to mostly detect new DWDs through eclipses (Eyer et al.
__label__positive 2012 ) and thus selecting mainly short-period ones.
__label__positive These DWDs are the most interesting for studying the ﬁnal stages of binary evolution and represent potential GW sources.
__label__positive Gaia is a space mission, launched on 2013 December 19, whose primary goal is to provide a detailed 3D distribution and space motion of a billion stars in our Galaxy (Gaia Collabora- tion et al.
__label__positive During 5 yr of mission, Gaia will deliver po- sitions, parallaxes and proper motions for all stars down to G/similarequal 20 over the whole sky.
__label__positive According to the GUMS (Gaia Universe Model Snapshot) simulation, Gaia will see between 250 000 and 500 000 WDs, and more than 60 per cent of them will be in binaries (Carrasco et al.
__label__positive Astrometrical and multicolour photometri- cal observations will be possible for the Galactic WD population.
__label__positive The majority of the Galactic WD population is too faint for the radial velocity spectrometer (RVS) onboard of the Gaia satellite, and even the brightest ones ( G<15) are typically featureless in RVS wavelength range.
__label__positive Thus, no radial velocities will be avail- able for these sources, so to fully characterize them ground-based spectroscopic followup will be necessary (Carrasco et al.
__label__positive The LSST is a ground-based telescope, currently under construc- tion and expected to be fully operational in 2022 (LSST Science Collaboration et al.
__label__positive It will complement the Gaia study of the Milky Way stellar population down to magnitude r/similarequal24, with a possibility to extend this photometric limit down to r/similarequal27 with image-stacking techniques.
__label__positive The LSST will detect about 10 billion stars up to distances of ∼100 kpc over half of the sky.
__label__positive In particular, it will allow the discovery of several millions of WDs (LSST Science Collaboration et al.
__label__positive The technical characteristics of the two instruments used for our study (sky coverage, average cadence, limiting magnitude and visibility constraints of the survey, etc.

__label__positive We compute the ﬂux of a binary for given binary parameters: a,R1,R2,r1,r2andd, where ais the binary orbital separation, R1andR2are the respective radii of the two binary components and r1andr2are their r-band magnitude.
__label__positive Note that in this work, we adopt the deﬁnition of the primary as the brightest WD, and secondary as the dimmest WD of the pair.
__label__positive In this simple treatment, the limb darkening effect is neglected, so stars are considered spherically symmetric with a uniform surface brightness distribution.
__label__positive Gravitational distortion (ellipsoidal varia- tion) and mutual heating are also not taken into account.
__label__positive Neglecting these effects implies looking for photometric variability caused by eclipses alone that limits our search to systems with a very narrow range of inclination angles i∼90◦.
__label__positive For DWDs, the variation in the light curve induced by mutual heating is not expected to be signif- icant, given the small size of WD stars and roughly equal size of binary components.
__label__positive We estimate the maximum ﬂux variation due to the mutual heating to be at most of the same order of magnitude as the average eclipse depth, if we assume the maximum efﬁciency for this process.
__label__positive To test whether including the ellipsoidal variation in our simulation could enlarge the sample of detectable sources, we estimate how many systems in our simulated population would show the maximum amplitude of the ellipsoidal variation greater than 1 per cent using the theoretical prediction from Hermes et al.
__label__positive (2012 ): L(φ) L=−3(15+u1)(1+τ1)(R1/a)3(m2/m1)s i n2i 20(3−u1)cos(2φ), (5) where Lis the total luminosity of the system, u1=0.1–0.5 and τ1=1.0 are the limb-darkening and gravity-darkening coefﬁ- cients for the primary and cos (2 φ)=1.
__label__positive We ﬁnd ∼20 systems with G/r<24 (in both formation scenarios) with the maximum amplitude of ellipsoidal variation greater than 1 per cent in our simulation.
__label__positive These are the closest and the lightest binaries in our synthetic population as expected from theoretical predictions (e.g.
__label__positive Thus, including ellipsoidal varia- tion in our simulation would increase the number of detected system by at most a couple of tens of systems.
__label__positive To evaluate the relative photometric error per single Gaia obser- vation, we use σG=1.2×10−3(0.048 95 z2+1.8633z+0.000 019 85)1/2,(6)where z=max [100.4(12 −15),1 00.4(G−15)] (Gaia Collaboration et al.
__label__positive To evaluate the expected photometric error per single observation with the LSST, we use σr=/parenleftBig σ2 sys+σ2 rand/parenrightBig1/2 , (7) where, according to LSST Science Collaboration et al.
__label__positive ( 2009 , section 3.5), σsys=0.005 is the systematic photometric error, σ2 rand=(0.04−˜γ)x+˜γx2,x=10(m−m5)is the random photomet- ric error, m5and ˜γare the 5 σlimiting magnitude for a given ﬁlter and the sky brightness in a given band, respectively.
__label__positive Finally, we add a Gaussian white noise to our synthetic light curves.
__label__positive The motion of the Gaia satellite is quite complex and cannot be expressed by an analytical formula: it is given by a combination of rotation of the satellite on its own axis, precession of the spin axis itself and the revolution around Sun (Eyer & Mignard 2005 ).
__label__positive Therefore, to get a realistic light curve sampling with Gaia ,w eu s e d theGaia Observation Forecast Tool2that provides a list of observing times (TCB) per target for a given period of observation and target position on the sky.
__label__positive To get a set of Gaia pointings for each binary in our simulation, we use the largest available time interval that spans from 2014-09-26T00:00:00 TCB to 2019-06-01T00:00:00 TCB ( ∼ 5 yr mission lifetime).
__label__positive To simulate the light curve sampling with the LSST, we use the anticipated regular cadence of 3 d over a nominal 10-yr life span of the mission.
__label__positive 2, we show a comparison of the light-curve sampling by Gaia (top panel) and LSST (bottom panel) for two binaries with similar orbital periods (21 min and 24 min).
__label__positive In order to count detections, we applied the following criteria.
__label__positive First, we check if the source presents variability by evaluating the χ2 value of the light curve with respect to the average source magnitude.
__label__positive To establish a χ2threshold value above which we consider a source as variable, we compute the χ2distribution of non-variable Galactic objects in the Gaia magnitude range.
__label__positive This simple test allows us to distinguish between variability due to a binary nature of the source and variability induced by photometric ﬂuctuations of observations of non-variable objects.
__label__positive In this simulation, we do not take into account any other type of variable stars present in the Galaxy such as pulsating WDs (DA Vs: ZZ Ceti), Delta Scuti and SX Phoenicis stars, or variability due to deformation or heating in these binaries (see e.g.
__label__positive In real data, these stars will exhibit a similar behaviour to eclipsing DWDs and will contaminate the sample of candidate DWDs.
__label__positive Thus, in general, additional analysis techniques will be required in order to conﬁrm DWD candidates.
__label__positive For the Gaia data, this analysis will be done by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (Eyer et al.
__label__positive 3that for χ2>2, there is little overlap between the population of non-variable sources (red histogram) and the population of eclipsing binaries.
__label__positive To be conservative, we adopt a threshold value of χ2=3.
__label__positive Finally, we require that a minimum number of data points, Nsamp,w i t hﬂ u xa tl e a s t3 σbelow the out- of-eclipse level, falls within the eclipse phase: for Gaia , we adopt Nsamp≥3 and for the LSST Nsamp≥10.
__label__positive This requirement introduces a constrain on the ratio between the duration of the eclipse phase tecl and the binary orbital period P, such that tecl/P=Nsamp/Ntot,w h e r e Ntotis the total number of observations per source (see Table 2).
__label__positive By using a geometrical argument, teclcan be estimated as the time it takes the occulting star to move twice the distance from the ﬁrst 2http://gaia.esac.esa.int/gost/ MNRAS 470, 1894–1910 (2017)Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/470/2/1894/3852305 by National Science & Technology Library Root Admin user on 01 April 2022

__label__positive From equation (8), we ﬁnd that the typical teclfor a DWD binary in our simulated population is around 2 min.
__label__positive Thus, we expect that Gaia will detect systems with typical periods P/lessorsimilar(teclNtot)/Nsamp/lessorsimilar 45 min.
__label__positive Following a similar reasoning, one can anticipate that LSST will detect eclipsing binaries with P/lessorsimilar3h .
__label__positive 3.2 Detection efﬁciency To assess the detection efﬁciency of the two instruments, we sim- ulate the sampling of a test light curve by varying the magnitude and period of a binary system with m1=0.53 M ⊙,m2=0.35 M ⊙, R2=0.017 R ⊙,R1=0.8R2,d=1 kpc and i=π/2.
__label__positive The chosen pa- rameters for the test light curve represent the average values in our simulated population.
__label__positive For each period Pin the range between 5 min and 10 h (with 10 min steps) and magnitude ( rorG) between 15 and the photometric limit of the instrument (with 0.25 mag steps), we calculate 100 realizations of the test light-curve sampling by ran- domly assigning the initial orbital phase.
__label__positive We determine whether the light curve was detected based on the criteria described in MNRAS 470, 1894–1910 (2017)Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/470/2/1894/3852305 by National Science & Technology Library Root Admin user on 01 April 2022

__label__positive The time step is 10 min and the magnitude step is 0.25.
__label__positive The colour indicates the instrument efﬁciency from 0 to 1.
__label__positive Finally, we represent the detection probability per bin as the number of times the test light curve was detected over 100 realizations.
__label__positive As discussed in Section 3.1, our detection test depends on the total number of observations per source Ntot.F o r Gaia ,Ntotis uniform in ecliptic longitude λand has a strong dependence on ecliptic latitude β:3Ntotis minimum at β∼0◦, increases up to ∼200 observations per source at β±45◦and decreases down to ∼70 at ecliptic poles β±90◦(Eyer & Mignard 2005 ).Gaia detection efﬁciency for β=0,+45,+60 and 90◦ecliptic latitudes is represented in Fig.
__label__positive 4, where the impact of the different number of observations is evident.
__label__positive 4shows that for any ﬁxed period (when the distance to the source is also ﬁxed), Gaia generally detects more efﬁciently brighter binaries, simply because of the photometric performance of the instrument.
__label__positive 4, for periods between 2 and 3 h, one can see that the efﬁciency drops from 0.4–0.3 to 0 for increasing magnitudes.
__label__positive However, for very short periods ( P /lessorsimilar20 min), the efﬁciency remains approximately constant even at the faint end of the Gaia visibility range, independent of the number 3https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/table-2-with-asciiof observations.
__label__positive At a ﬁxed magnitude, Gaia cadence works better for detection of short-period sources: for G=18, the efﬁciency is>0.4 for P<4ha n d >0.9 for P<30 min (Fig.
__label__positive This is a consequence of the fact that the eclipse duration is set by the geometry of the system, so the time that the system spends in eclipse compared to the total orbital period is longer for systems with shorter periods (i.e.
__label__positive Thus, it is more likely to catch the binary in eclipse phase when the period of the binary is shorter.
__label__positive By using this simple argument and assuming a regular cadence of 70 observations, one can preliminarily estimate the average number of detections by counting the number of DWDs in our synthetic population that satisfy tecl/P≥3/70.
__label__positive For the LSST, we ﬁnd that the average cadence of one observation in 3 d and the high number of data points make it very efﬁcient at all magnitudes for all orbital periods /lessorsimilar10 h.

__label__positive 3.3 Results For each binary in our simulated population, we compute 100 light curve realizations by randomizing over the initial orbital phase.
__label__positive We deﬁne the probability of detection as the fraction of times the light curve was positively detected over the total number of light- curve realizations.
__label__positive The following results pertain the fraction of the total Galactic DWD population that is (1) above the photometric limit of the instrument, (2) eclipsing given the orientation with respect to the detector (i.e.
__label__positive such that cos i≤(R1+R2)/a)a n d( 3 ) in a sky position covered by the survey.
__label__positive In the reminder, we call this population ‘ Gaia /LSST input population’.
__label__positive Note that the input population represents the maximum detectable sample for a given survey.
__label__positive We ﬁnd that 190 (250) binaries have a non-zero probability4 to be detected by Gaia in the αα(γα) scenario in 5-yr mission lifetime.
__label__positive This represents ∼50 per cent of the Gaia input population in both formation scenarios.
__label__positive Such detection percentage is due to the sparse Gaia sampling that spread over the 5-yr mission time makes it difﬁcult to detect systems with very narrow eclipses (see Section 3.2).
__label__positive The average number of detected binaries weighed by the detection probability is 30 for the ααa n d5 0f o rt h e γαCE model, respectively.
__label__positive Essentially, Gaia will be sensitive to eclipsing binaries with orbital periods less than a few hours (50 per cent of these have periods <1.6 h, see Fig.
__label__positive The most distant binary detected by Gaia is atd=3.5 kpc.
__label__positive In addition, we ﬁnd that a possible extension of the Gaia mission up to 10 yr (Gaia Collaboration et al.
__label__positive 2016 , section 5.3.2) will double the average number of detections compared to the nominal 5-yr mission lifetime.
__label__positive Incidentally, when we use a random sampling of the orbital phase, instead of using detailed Gaia cadence, we obtain twice as many detections.
__label__positive Compared to Gaia , the ability of the LSST to see much fainter sources gives an order of magnitude more eclipsing binaries: 1100 (1460) DWDs have a non-zero probability of being detected.
__label__positive These detections represent ∼65 per cent of the LSST input population (for 4A non-zero probability according to our deﬁnition means at least one detection out of 100 (i.e.

__label__positive The black continuous line represents the median of the detected periods in our simulation and dashed line marks the limit of the LISA band.
__label__positive The average number of detected binaries weighed by the probability for the LSST is 850 (1167) DWDs for theαα(γα) scenario.
__label__positive The maximum distance in the LSST-detected sample is ∼10 kpc.
__label__positive Notably, half of the population detected by both instruments has periods shorter than 1.5 h as shown in Fig.
__label__positive This substantial subsample has orbital frequencies, f=1/P, larger than 0.1 mHz, and thus is potentially detectable through GW radiation in the LISA band (see Section 4).
__label__positive Both Gaia and LSST will enlarge the number of very short-period binaries, as the mean period of Gaia and LSST detections peaks around 1.5 h, while the mean period of the ELM binaries is 7.4 h (Gianninas et al.
__label__positive 7, we show the distribution of DWDs weighed by the de- tection probability in different 2D parameter spaces: the magnitude– period distribution5(top panels), magnitude–Galactic latitude (mid- dle panels) and longitude (bottom panels) distributions, where colours trace the detection probability.
__label__positive 7represent the respective distributions of all sources with non-zero probability of detection.
__label__positive Despite the fact that Gaia is more efﬁcient at brighter magnitudes (Fig.
__label__positive 4), one can see that the majority of the detected population is faint ( G<18) and has periods less than a few hours (P<3 h).
__label__positive The former result reﬂects the magnitude distribution of the input population that peaks around the faint end of the Gaia visibility range and the latter is a consequence of our detection cri- terion as discussed in Section 3.1.
__label__positive 7, it is evident that the LSST with its deeper photometric limit has access to a much larger fraction of the total population.
__label__positive In particular, while Gaia operates in the same magnitude range of the ELM ground-based optical survey, the LSST will extend the sam- ple of known DWDs to lower magnitudes.
__label__positive However, the follow-up spectroscopy of such a faint sources will be a challenge even for upcoming facilities.
__label__positive 7, we represent the spatial distribution of Gaia and LSST detections.
__label__positive Because of its 5Note that we show only a part of the magnitude–period parameter space, where the majority of the detected population is located, while the whole range of detected periods extends up to a few days for both instruments, where the detections are sparsely distributed.

__label__positive The error bars (in blue for Gaia and in black for the LSST) represent Poissonian errors.

__label__positive These fractions are deﬁned as a number of detected sources over the number of binaries of the input popula- tion per bin.
__label__positive For both instruments, the fraction of detections drops for increasing orbital periods (top panel).
__label__positive Note, however, that the fraction of long period binaries ( P>24 h) is higher for Gaia (>0.2) due to a non-uniform sampling of the light curves.
__label__positive The middle panel reﬂects the average detection fraction of the instru- ments, with no clear preference in magnitude.
__label__positive Both instruments detect high fraction of binaries with q>1 (bottom panel), i.e.
__label__positive By deﬁnition, the primary is the brightest WD (and consequently the biggest) of the pair, so a wider range of inclination angles is allowed for these systems in order to be detected as eclipsing sources, and thus they are more likely to be detected.
__label__positive In our simulation, these systems are typically formed via stable mass transfer.
__label__positive However, taking into account the size of the error bars, the distribution looks consistent with a ﬂat distribution.
__label__positive Fig.9illustrates the number of detected sources as a function of the mass ratio: top panel for the ααand bottom panel for the γαCE model.
__label__positive The two distributions are different: the population formed by the ααmodel shows a prominent peak around q∼0.5, while the population formed with γαpeaks at q∼1.
__label__positive Despite the γαCE prescription being designed to match the observed DWD binaries (Nelemans et al.
__label__positive 2000 ; Nelemans & Tout 2005 ), the number of currently known sources is too low to prefer it with respect to the ααCE model.
__label__positive 9shows that the Gaia sample has the potential to shed light on the nature of the CE phase and physical process that triggers it in DWD progenitor systems, as one can already see the difference between the two models by comparing the purple histograms.

__label__positive 10, we illustrate some of the properties of Gaia and LSST detections formed by the γαscenario in different 2D parameter spaces where each source is weighed by the detection probability; the inserts represent the respective distributions of the sources with a non-zero probability of being detected.
__label__positive The detected population will consist of binaries with secondaries typically more massive than primaries.
__label__positive The majority of known DWDs were discovered by ELM survey, designed to search for extremely low mass primaries, thus new eclipsing binaries detected by Gaia and LSST will extend this parameter space to binaries with more massive primaries.
__label__positive Note that LSST has potential to detect systems with m1+m2>Chan- drasekhar mass limit, providing some SN Ia progenitor candidates.
__label__positive Moreover, the detected population will have primaries hotter than secondaries; therefore, it will be difﬁcult to determine directly the properties of the secondaries.
__label__positive 10, we represent the distribution of the detected sources in period–temperature and temperature–magnitude space, useful for planning of the spectroscopic followup of these sources.
__label__positive 4 GW DETECTION In this section, we focus our attention on DWDs as GW sources.
__label__positive First, we recall some basic formulae for the estimation of the GW signal.
__label__positive To simulate the LISA instrument response, in this paper, we adopt the frequency-based method of Cornish & Larson ( 2003 ,s e e also Cutler 1998 ; Cornish & Rubbo 2003 ).
__label__positive Then, we estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of currently observed DWD binaries to verify our procedure.
__label__positive The following step is to calculate the SNR for all synthetic binaries to identify those with the highest SNR.
__label__positive Finally, we compare our result with previous works (Nelemans et al.
__label__positive 2012 ) ,b a s e do na different Galactic model populations.
__label__positive LISA is a space-based GW interferometer, conceived as a set of three spacecrafts in an equilateral triangle constellation of a few million kilometres per side.
__label__positive Such spacecraft separation sets the sensitivity range of the instrument from about 0.1–100 mHz and will allow the detection of Galactic and extra-Galactic sources, among which thousands will be DWD binaries (Amaro-Seoane et al.
__label__positive The detector’s centre of mass will follow a circular heliocentric trajectory, trailing 22◦behind the Earth and maintaining a6 0◦inclination between the plane of the detector and the ecliptic plane.
__label__positive As the reference LISA conﬁguration in this work, we adopt the LISA Mission Concept recently submitted as a response to the ESA call for L3 missions (hereafter ESACall v1.1).
__label__positive The ESACall v1.1 is a three-arm conﬁguration6with 2.5 ×106km arm length instead of 5 ×106km arm length as in the original LISA project (see e.g.
__label__positive The sensitivity of the ESACall v1.1 conﬁguration is based on the latest results from the LISA Pathﬁnder mission (Armano et al.
__label__positive 2016 ), a precursor mission designed to test the technologies needed for the laser interferometry in space.
__label__positive As pointed out by several authors, at frequencies below a few mHz the expected number of Galactic binaries per frequency bin (/Delta1f=1/Tobs,w h e r e Tobsis the total observation time) is so large that these binaries will form an unresolvable foreground signal in the detector (e.g.

__label__positive computed by using our model population (Amaro-Seoane et al.
__label__positive 4.1 GW signal from DWDs The great majority of Galactic DWD binaries can be well described using Newtonian dynamics of circular orbits, under the assumption that the binary can be represented by two point masses in orbit (e.g.
__label__positive The GWs they produce can be computed using the quadrupole approximation (see e.g.
__label__positive Considering that the time- scale on which DWDs typically evolve ( >Myr) is much greater than the lifetime of the LISA mission ( ∼yr), they can be treated as monochromatic sources emitting at the frequency fs=2/P.I n this approximation, the GW signal emitted by a binary is given by a combination of the two polarizations: h+(t)=2(GM)5/3(πfs)2/3 c4d(1+cos2i)c o s2 /Phi1(t), (9) h×(t)=−4(GM)5/3(πfs)2/3 c4dcosisin 2/Phi1(t), (10) whereM=(m1m2)3/5(m1+m2)−1/5is the chirp mass of the sys- tem and /Phi1(t)=/Phi10+πfstis the orbital phase.
__label__positive In the low-frequency limit ( fs/lessmuchc/2πL∼20 mHz, where L=2.5 Mkm is the detector’s arm length), the GW signal as measured by the detector can be expressed as h(t)=F+h+(t)+F×h×(t), (11) where F+andF×are the detector pattern functions that encode the dependence of the waveform on the source location in the sky and orientation with respect to the detector and conﬁguration (see equations 9–11 of Cornish & Larson 2003 , for speciﬁc expression of these functions).

__label__positive Consequently, they represent guaranteed sources for the mission.
__label__positive Some of these binaries will be detected in a short period after the beginning of the mission ( ∼few months), and thus can be used to verify the performance of the instrument (e.g.
__label__positive Binary parameters and SNR values for 1-yr mis- sion lifetime of the LISA veriﬁcation binaries are reported in table B1.

__label__positive 5 THE COMBINED EM AND GW SAMPLE In the two previous sections, we showed that the expected num- ber of DWD detections through EM and GW radiation within next two decades is signiﬁcant.
__label__positive So far GW studies focused on currently known Galactic binaries or on the future EM follow-up of these sources, ignoring the fact that revolutionary optical surveys such as Gaia and the LSST will be available between now and the LISA launch.
__label__positive In this section, we want to estimate how many DWDs de- tected by Gaia and LSST will be bright enough in GWs to be detected by the LISA.
__label__positive Starting from the Gaia and LSST samples (Section 3), we com- pute the SNR for the LISA ESACallv1.1 conﬁguration and 4 yr mission lifetime, and we select those with SNR >7( s e eT a b l e 4).
__label__positive We ﬁnd 13 and 25 combined Gaia and LISA detections, respec- tively, for the ααandγαCE models.
__label__positive Combined LSST and LISA samples are 3–4 times bigger: 50 in the ααformation scenario and 73 for in γαscenario.
__label__positive This result shows that before the LISA launch, we will have at least twice as many guaranteed LISA detections with SNR>7.
__label__positive The period of the combined detections will range from a f e wm i n u t e st o1ha n dw i l lb eo na v e r a g e( a sf o rc u r r e n t l yk n o w n LISA veriﬁcation binaries) around 15 min (see Fig.
__label__positive As for the sample of known veriﬁcation binaries (Table A1), the mass of the primary, secondary and consequently the chirp mass of these bina-ries is not expected to exceed 1 M ⊙.
__label__positive Veriﬁcation binaries provided byGaia are not expected to be found at distances larger than the already known ones, while the LSST will double the maximum distance because of its deeper photometric limit (Fig.
__label__positive Several authors have already pointed out that for those sources that could be detected in both EM and GW waves much more infor- mation can be gained compare to either EM or GW can provide alone (see e.g.
__label__positive Light curves allow the measurement of the orbital period, the incli- nation angle and the scaled radii of the binary components ( R1/a andR2/a), that, in turn, can be used to determine the binary mass ratio from the mass–radius relationship.
__label__positive This information combined with the chirp mass determined from the GW data, in principle, per- mits the estimation of the individual binary component masses.
__label__positive For monochromatic sources, like the majority of DWD binaries, GW data will provide the measurement of the chirp mass in combina- tion with distance (see the dependence on Manddin equations 9 and 10).
__label__positive Thus, parallax measurements by Gaia and LSST will be crucial to determine the distances and to break this degeneracy.
__label__positive The measure of the binary frequency evolution ( ˙f, that is not likely from GW data for all DWDs) can be equivalently determined from eclipse timing (Shah & Nelemans 2014 ).
__label__positive Furthermore, the EM observations can be also used to constrain GW observables and to improve their accuracy.
__label__positive In fact, there are several correlations between the GW and EM observable quantities, e.g.
__label__positive between GW amplitude and binary inclination, ecliptic latitude and longitude.
__label__positive For example, an a priori knowledge of the source sky position and inclination can give an MNRAS 470, 1894–1910 (2017)Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/470/2/1894/3852305 by National Science & Technology Library Root Admin user on 01 April 2022

__label__positive ( 2012 ) showed that small inclination errors from GW data imply that system is eclips- ing; consequently, this fact can be used for the EM detection of new eclipsing sources.
__label__positive 6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS In this work, we have computed the expected number of DWD detections by Gaia and the LSST as eclipsing sources and by the future LISA mission as GW sources.
__label__positive As in earlier studies, we relied on population synthesis modelling because of the small number of the known systems.
__label__positive To simulate the Galactic population of DWD binaries, we considered two different prescriptions for the CE phase(ααandγα) in order to investigate whether Gaia , LSST and LISA will elucidate on the nature of the CE phase.
__label__positive We ﬁnd that Gaia can provide up to a few hundred of eclipsing detached DWDs, while LSST will extend this sample up to almost 2 ×103sources.
__label__positive Then, we investigated the number of individually resolvable GW sources considering the latest mission concept of the LISA detector submitted as a response to the ESA call for L3 missions in 2017.
__label__positive We ﬁnd that the number of detectable detached DWDs is 25 ×103for the nominal 4 yr of mission lifetime.
__label__positive Finally, we used the obtained EM samples to estimate how many veriﬁcation binaries Gaia and LSST will provide before the LISA launch.
__label__positive We ﬁnd several tens of combined EM and GW detection.
__label__positive These detections will signiﬁcantly increase the sample of know LISA veriﬁcation binaries by at least factor of 2.
__label__positive To investigate the sensitivity of our results to assumptions on the initial stellar population, we performed a set of simulations with two different IMFs and with a different mass ratio distribution.
__label__positive We ﬁnd that the same star formation history but a different choice for the IMF inﬂuences mostly the total number of generated DWDs and has a relatively moderate impact on the number of detections.
__label__positive For example, the Miller & Scalo ( 1979 ) and the Scalo ( 1986 )I M F , that are steeper than the Kroupa IMF for M>1M⊙, produce, respectively, ∼10 per cent more DWD systems that translates di- rectly in 10 per cent more detections by Gaia , LSST and LISA.
__label__positive On the other hand, the assumption on the mass ratio distribution proves to have a non-negligible impact on our results.
__label__positive In general, a power law f(q)∝qbcan be used to describe this distribution, where bdepends on the stellar population.
__label__positive For intermediate-mass stars, the value of branges between 0 and −1 (Duch ˆene & Kraus 2013 ).
__label__positive Thus, in addition to our previous simulation (in which we used b=0), we performed a simulation with b=− 1 to com- pare the two limiting cases.
__label__positive Such a power law favours unequal mass binaries that need more than a Hubble time to form a DWD.
__label__positive Therefore, we ﬁnd six times less DWDs than in the original sim- ulation, and, consequently, roughly six times less detections.
__label__positive To verify which of the two mass ratio distributions produce a popu- lation that is more compatible with observations, we compare the number of synthetic and observed binaries in the Solar neighbour- hood (see unresolved DWD in table 1 of Toonen et al.
__label__positive We ﬁnd that the ﬂat mass ratio distribution produces 7 ±3D W D s within 20 pc, while a power law with b=−1 predicts only 1+3 −1.I n the observed sample, there is one conﬁrmed isolated DWD and ﬁve DWD candidates.
__label__positive The candidates are stars with estimated masses that are too low ( ≤0.5 M⊙) to have evolved as single stars, thus it is highly likely that these are binary stars with undetected com- panions (see Toonen et al.
__label__positive Because of the large uncertainties in the number of DWDs from both sides: observations and simulations, we cannot place a strong constrain on our synthetic models.
__label__positive We can only conclude that our ﬁducial model, with the ﬂat mass ratio distribution, is more consistent with the observed numbers within the uncertainties when including the DWD candidates.
__label__positive The subset of Gaia and LSST binaries analysed in this work rep- resents guaranteed detections for the LISA mission and will provide a powerful tool for probing WD astrophysics and a unique oppor- tunity of multimessenger study for this class of objects.
__label__positive No other GW sources are expected to provide so large number of combined GW and EM detections.
__label__positive We defer to future work for the parameter estimation from EM and GW data for the sample of the combined EM and GW detections and the study of the applicability of these data to the study of the effects of tides in ultra-compact binaries and the kinematics of the Galaxy.
