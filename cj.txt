hafsteinsson; frederic m. evers; willi h. hager keywords: experimentation; hydraulics; solitary wave; wave breaking; wave run-up abstract: the run-up features of breaking solitary waves over a plane sloping beach are described using both high-speed images and a systematic data analysis. experiments were conducted in a smooth, rectangular and prismatic channel. the main hydraulic parameters investigated include relative wave height, stillwater depth, and channel bottom inclination. the various types of wave breaking are discussed, including the plunging, spilling, and surging breaker types in addition to the amplitude evolution due to wave shoaling. furthermore, the generation and propagation of bores is examined. a detailed data analysis, based on hydraulic similitude, allows for deriving mathematical expressions that are considered to represent the observed wave features. the research includes film-like image series describing the wave run-up features, allowing for a description of the flow complexities observed and the beauties associated with wave run-up. this research excludes a numerical analysis, given the complexities due to turbulence generation and air entrainment.the radial distribution of galactic gamma rays. ii - the distribution of cosmic-ray electrons and nuclei in the outer galaxy publication date: 16 june 1984 authors: bloemen, j.b.g.m., et al. journal: astronomy and astrophysics copyright: european southern observatory in the present derivation of the radial distribution of high energy gamma-ray emissivity in the outer milky way, the kinematics of h i are used to construct column-density maps in various galactocentric distance ranges that are then used in combination with cos-b spacecraft gamma-ray data to determine emissivities in these distance ranges. the results obtained imply a hardening of the gamma-ray spectrum with increasing distance, and include an energy-dependent decrease that is interpreted as a steep gradient in the cosmic-ray electron density and a near constancy of the nuclear component. the galactic origin of electrons with energies of up to several hundreds of mevs is confirmed.link to publicationa group of astronomers from the u.s., europe, chile and south africa have determined that a recently discovered dim star is likely to have passed through the solar system’s distant cloud of comets, the oort cloud. no other star is known to have ever approached our solar system this close—five times closer than the closest star, proxima centauri. in a paper published in astrophysical journal letters, lead author eric mamajek from the university of rochester and his collaborators analyzed the velocity and trajectory of a low-mass star system nicknamed “scholz’s star.” the star’s trajectory suggests that 70,000 years ago it passed roughly 0.8 light years (5 trillion miles) from the sun. this is astronomically close—our closest neighbor star today, proxima centauri, is 4.2 light years distant. in fact, the astronomers are 98% certain that it passed through what is known as the “outer oort cloud”—a region at the edge of the solar system filled with trillions of comets a mile or more across that are thought to give rise to long-period comets orbiting the sun after their orbits are perturbed. the star originally caught mamajek’s attention during a discussion with co-author valentin d. ivanov, from the european southern observatory. scholz’s star had an unusual mix of characteristics: despite being fairly close (only 20 light years away), it showed very slow tangential motion, that is, motion across the sky. the radial velocity measurements taken by ivanov and collaborators, however, showed the star moving almost directly away from the solar system at considerable speed. mamajek worked with former university of rochester undergraduate scott barenfeld (now a graduate student at caltech) to simulate 10,000 orbits for the star, of those simulations, 98% showed the star passing through the outer oort cloud, but fortunately only one of the simulations brought the star within the inner oort cloud, which could trigger so-called “comet showers.” while the close flyby of scholz’s star likely had little impact on the oort cloud, mamajek points out that “other dynamically important oort cloud perturbers may be lurking among nearby stars.” the recently launched european space agency gaia satellite is expected to map out the distances and measure the velocities of a billion stars. with the gaia data, astronomers will be able to tell which other stars may have had a close encounter with us in the past or will in the future. currently, scholz’s star is a small, dim red dwarf in the constellation of monoceros the unicorn, about 20 light years away. at the closest point in its flyby of the solar system, scholz’s star would have been a 10th magnitude star—about 50 times fainter than can normally be seen with the naked eye. it is magnetically active, however, which can cause stars to “flare” and briefly become thousands of times brighter. so it is possible that scholz’s star may have been visible to the naked eye by our ancestors 70,000 years ago for minutes or hours at a time during rare flaring events. the star is part of a binary star system: a low-mass red dwarf star (with mass about 8% that of the sun) and a “brown dwarf” companion (with mass about 6% that of the sun). brown dwarfs are considered “failed stars”; their masses are too low to fuse hydrogen in their cores like a star, but they are still much more massive than gas giant planets like jupiter.samsung launched the galaxy s21 fe 5g in india in january 2022 as the toned-down version of the flagship galaxy s21. last year, the company reportedly skipped the launch of the galaxy s22 fe due to the chip shortage and increased demand for the flagship galaxy s22 ultra smartphone. now, as per reports, the south korean tech giant will launch the galaxy s23 fe later this year. a south korean publication, hankooki, has reported that samsung plans to launch the galaxy s23 fe around august-september this year. the reports also indicate that samsung will not release the galaxy a74 smartphone in 2023 to expand the sale of the galaxy s23 fe. it is unclear if samsung will release the galaxy s23 fe in global markets or if it will be limited to select countries. to recall, samsung released the galaxy s21 fe in select markets, including india, europe, and the us. the upcoming galaxy s23 fe smartphone could feature the snapdragon 8 gen 2 or snapdragon 8+ gen 1 chipset. more details should be available in the coming months about the galaxy s23 fe smartphone.there are several components solar equipment suppliers ny install on rooftop systems. notably, solar technological advancements are making it

systems. importantly, the inverter is the solar component that converts the sun’s direct current (dc) into usable alternating current (ac). typically, solar contractors offer customers the choice between string inverters and microinverters. with a string inverter, the entire string of solar panels is affected if one of the solar panels is shaded. thus, solar installers typically recommend this technology for larger non-residential systems without shading concerns. on the other hand, microinverters are mounted directly behind each solar panel. indeed, the energy conversion happens at the modular level, maximizing potential system output. absolutely, ask your solar equipment supplier new york about their microinverter options. solar array mounting racks in addition, solar suppliers ny also install solar array mounting racks for rooftop systems. typically, solar arrays are mounted on your rooftop with a few gap inches between the panels and your home’s structure. solar installers use the racking system to attach your panels to your rooftop securely. if your roof is flat, then solar panel installers clifton nj and other areas usually align the solar array at an angle. often, professional solar installers measure the slope of your roof and evaluate your home’s sun exposure to determine the best angle for the solar panels. ideally, you should ask your solar provider about different rack brands’ durability. certainly, solar array mounting racks are a key component for your ny home solar system. moreover, ny solar equipment suppliers also offer monitoring equipment for home solar systems. usually, monitoring equipment connects to your inverter manufacturer. notably, they collect and relay system energy analytics from the inverter to a product console or web-connected device. for example, customers with an enphase microinverter often utilize enphase monitoring technology to assess their system performance. usually, monitoring technology can display real-time data on the energy generated by the solar panels. within your monitoring application, you can often view efficiency and troubleshoot system issues. absolutely, monitoring equipment is a major system component ny solar energy providers install on rooftop systems. solar power system disconnects furthermore, ny solar suppliers also install solar power system disconnects for residential systems. typically, these function as an electrical switch to disconnect and cut off the dc power output from your solar panels. notably, the system disconnect is critical if your solar array should need any repairs throughout its lifespan. indeed, solar contractors may need to shut off the power to optimize safety as they make the repair. additionally, the disconnect switch must be strong enough to handle the full power output from the panels on a bright sunny day. in short, solar system disconnects are an essential component ny rooftop solar suppliers install on residential systems. there are several components solar equipment suppliers ny install on rooftop systems. first, solar panels are a primary component to consider as you choose your system components. next, solar energy
